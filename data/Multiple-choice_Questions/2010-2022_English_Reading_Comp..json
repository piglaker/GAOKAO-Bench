            "question": "C \nAlong  the river  banks  of the Amazon  and the Orinoco  there  lives  a bird that \nswims  before  it can fly, flies like a fat chicken , eats green  leaves , has the stomach  of a \ncow and has claws（爪） on its wings  when  young . They  build  their homes  about  \n4.6m  above  the river , an important  feature（特征） for the safety  of the young . It is \ncalled  the hoatzin . \nIn appearance , the birds  of both sexes  look very much  alike  with brown  on the \n  back  and cream  and red on the underside . The head  is small , with a large  set of \nfeathers  on the top, bright  red eyes, and blue skin. Its nearest  relatives  are the common  \nbirds , cuckoos . Its most  striking  feature , though , is only found  in the young . \nBaby  hoatzins  have  a claw  on the leading  edge  of each wing  and another  at the \nend of each wing  tip. Using  these  four claws , together  with the beak（喙） , they can \nclimb  about  in the bushes , looking  very much  like primitive  birds  must  have  done . \nWhen  the young  hoatzins  have  learned  to fly, they lose their claws . \nDuring  the drier  months  between  December  and March  hoatzins  fly about  the \nforest  in groups  of 20 to 30 birds , but in April , when  the rainy  season  begins , they \ncollect  together  in smaller  living  units  of two to seven  birds  for producing  purposes . \n63.

            "question": "D \nScience  can’t explain  the power  of pets, but many  studies  have  shown  that the \n  company  of pets can help lower  blood  pressure （血压） and raise  chances  of \nrecovering  from  a heart  attack , reduce  loneliness  and spread  all-round  good  cheer . \nAny owner  will tall you how much  joy a pet brings . For some , an animal  \nprovides  more  comfort  than a husband/wife . A 2002  study  by Karen  Allen  of the State  \nUniversity  of New  York  measured  stress（紧张） levels  and blood  pressure  in people  \n--- half of them  pet owners  --- while  they performed  5 minutes  of mental  arithmetic （\n算术） or held a hand  in ice water . Subjects  completed  the tasks  alone , with a \nhusband/wife , a close  friend  or with a pet. People  with pets did it best. Those  tested  \nwith their animal  friends  had smaller  change  in blood  pressure  and returned  most  \nquickly  to baseline  heart  rates . With  pets in the room , people  also made  fewer  math  \nmistakes  than when  doing  in front  of other  companions . It seems  people  feel more  \nrelaxed（放松） around  pets, says Allen , who thinks  it may be because  pets don’t \njudge . \nA study  reported  last fall suggests  that having  a pet dog not only raises  your \nspirits  but may also have  an effect  on your eating  habits . Researchers  at Northwestern  \nMemorial  Hospital  spent  a year studying  36 fat people  and their equally  fat dogs  on \ndiet-and-exercise  programs ; a separate  group  of 56 people  without  pets were  put on a \ndiet program . On average , people  lost about  I1 pounds , or 5% of their body  weight . \nTheir  dogs  did even  better , losing  an average  of 12 pounds , more  than 15% of their \nbody  weight . Dog owners  didn’t lose any more  weight  than those  without  dogs  but, \nsay researchers , got more  exercise  overall  --- mostly  with their dogs  --- and found  it \nworth  doing . \n67. What  does the text mainly  discuss？　   　 \nA. What  pets bring  to their owners .      B. How  pets help people  calm  down . \nC. People ’s opinions  of keeping  pets.    D. Pet’s value  in medical  research . \n68.

According  to Allen , why did the people  do better  with pets around  when  facing  \n  stressful  tasks ? 　   　 \nA. They  have  lower  blood  pressure .     B. They  become  more  patient . \nC. They  are less nervous .             D. They  are in higher  spirits . \n70.

            "question": "C \nThousands  of people  living  in the Chinese  capital  will celebrate  the start of the \nChinese  New  year by heading  for the ski resorts（滑雪场） . Never  mind  that \nBeijing ’s dry weather  seldom  produces  snow . It is cold enough  in winter  for snow  --- \nmaking  machines  to make  a covering  for the hills north  to the capital . And the rapid  \ngrowth  of a pleasure  --- seeking  middle  class  has formed  the basis  for this new craze\n（热潮） .  \nSince  Beijing ’s first ski resort  was opened  ten years  ago, the sport  has enjoyed  \nastonishing  increase . There  are now more  than a dozen  resorts . Clothes  markets  in the \ncity have  added  bright  colored  ski suits to their winter  collections . Mr. Wei, a \nmanager  of a newly -opened  ski resort  in Beijing , sees the growth  of an industry  that \ncould  soon  lead Chinese  to head  for the ski resorts  of Europe . In recent  years  ski \nresorts  offering  natural  snow  have  opened  in China . But many  are in faraway  areas  of \nthe country  and can’t really  match  the equipment  and services  of some  ski resorts  in \nEurope .  \nBeijing ’s skiing  craze  is partly  a result  of the recent  increase  in private（私有的\n） cars. This has led to the growth  of a leisure  industry  in the capital ’s suburbs（郊区\n）, which  until the late-1990s  were  unreachable  to ordinary  people . According  to Mr.  \nWei, about  40% of the visitors  to his resort  come  in their own cars. The rest are bused  \nin by schools , businesses  or government  offices .  \nThe problem  is making  money . Starting  ski resorts  requires  quite  a lot of money ;  \nhiring  land from  the local  government , preparing  the hills, buying  snow  machines , \nmaking  sure there  are enough  water  and electricity  to run them , and buying  ski \nequipment  for hiring  out to customers .  \nThe ski resort  where  Mr. Wei works  cost nearly  $4m to set up. And as so often  in \nChina  when  someone  comes  up with a good  idea, many  others  hash in and price  wars  \nbreak  out. Beijing  now offers  some  of the cheapest  ski training  classes  in the world , \nthough  with most  people  rather  new to the sport , expecting  a few more  doing  the same  \n  job.  \n50. What  does this text mainly  talk about？　   　 \nA. Convenience  for skiers  brought  about  by private  cars.  \nB. Skiing  as a new way of enjoying  one’s spare  time.  \nC. Things  to be considered  when  starting  a ski resort .  \nD. A sudden  increase  of ski training  classes  in Beijing .  \n51. Why  are some  Chinese  likely  to go skiing  in Europe？　   　 \nA. To visit more  ski areas .              B. To ski on natural  snow .  \nC. For a large  collection  of ski suits.      D. For better  services  and equipment .  \n52.

Those  sounds , whether  spoken  or written  in letters , \nare called  words .  \nThe power  of words , then, lies in their associations ---the things  they bring  up to \nour minds . Words  become  filled  with meaning  for us by experience ; and the longer  \nwe tire, the more  certain  words  bring  back  to us the happy  and sad events  of our past; \nand the more  we read and learn , the more  the number  of words  that mean  something  \nto us increases .  \nGreat  writers  are those  who not only have  great  thoughts  but also express  these  \nthoughts  in words  which  have  powerful  effects  on our minds  and feelings .

An animal  that is aware（意识）of itself  \nhas a high level  of intelligence . \n  Awareness  can be tested  by studying  whether  the animal  recognizes  itself  in the \nmirror , that is, its own reflected  image（反射出的影像） . Many  animals  fail this \nexercise  bitterly , paying  very little attention  to the reflected  image . Only  humans , and \nsome  intelligent  animals  like apes and dolphins , have  shown  to recognize  that the \nimage  in the mirror  is of themselves . \nNow  another  animal  has joined  the club. In the Proceedings  of the National  \nAcademy  of Sciences , researchers  report  that an Asian  elephant  has passed  the mirror  \nself-reflection  test. \n“We thought  that elephants  were  the next important  animal ,” said Dinana  Reiss  \nof the Wildlife  Conservation  Society , an author  of the study  with Joshua  M. Plotnik  \nand Fans  B.M. de Waal  of Emory  University . With  their large  brains , Reiss  said, \nelephants  “seemed  like cousins  to apes and dolphins .” \nThe researchers  tested  Happy , Maxine  and Patty , three  elephants  at the Bronx  \nZoo. They  put an 8-foot-square  mirror  on a wall of the animals ’ play area（out of the \nsight  of zoo visitors）and recorded  what  happened  with cameras , including  one built \nin the mirror . \nThe elephants  used their long noses  to find what  was behind  it, and to examine  \nparts  of their bodies . \nOf the three , Happy  then passed  the test, in which  a clear  mark  was painted  on \none side of her face. She could  tell the mark  was there  by looking  in the mirror , and \nshe used the mirror  to touch  the mark  with her long nose. \nDiana  Reiss  said, “We knew  elephants  were  intelligent , but now we can talk \nabout  their intelligence  in a better  way.” \n45. What  can mirror  tests tell us about  animals ? 　   　 \nA. Whether  they have  large  brains . \nB. Whether  they have  self-awareness . \nC. Whether  they enjoy  outdoor  exercises . \nD. Whether  they enjoy  playing  with mirrors . \n46. Why  does the author  mention  apes and dolphins  in the text? 　   　 \nA. They  are most  familiar  to readers . \n  B. They  are big favorites  with zoo visitors . \nC. They  are included  in the study  by Reiss . \nD. They  are already  known  to be intelligent . \n47. What  made  Happy  different  from  Maxine  and Patty ? 　   　 \nA. She used her nose to search  behind  the mirror . \nB. She recognized  her own image  in the mirror . \nC. She painted  a mark  on her own face. \nD. She found  the hidden  camera .\n",

            "question": "D \nThe way we do things  round  here  \nSome  years  ago, I was hired  by an American  bank . I received  a letter  from  the \nhead  of the Personnel  Department  that started , “Dear  John , I am quite  pleased  that you \nhave  decided  to join us.” That “quite ” saddened  me. I thought  he was saying  “we’re \nkind of pleased  you decided  to join us although  I wish  we had hired  someone  else.” \nThen  I discovered  that in American  English  “quite ” sometimes  means  “very”, while  \nin British  English  it means  “fairly ”. \nSo the first lesson  about  working  in other  countries  is to learn  the language  and \nby that I don’t just mean  the words  people  speak . It is body  language , dress , manners , \nideas  and so on. The way people  do things  highlights  many  of the differences  we see \nbetween  cultures（文化） . \nSome  of these  differences  may be only on the surface  --- dress , food and hours  of \nwork  --- while  others  may be deeper  and take longer  to deal with. Mostly , it is just a \nquestion  of getting  used to the differences  and accepting  them , like the climate（气候\n）, while  getting  on with business . \nSome  of the differences  may be an improvement . People  are more  polite ; the \n  service  is better ; you ask for something  to be done  and it happens  without  having  to \nask again . However , other  differences  can be troubling , like punctuality （准时） . If \nyou invite  people  to a party  at 7 o’clock  your guests  will consider  it polite  to turn up \nexactly  on time in Germany , five minutes  early  in the American  Midwest , an hour \nearly  in Japan , 15 minutes  afterwards  in the UK, up to an hour afterwards  in Italy and \nsome  time in the evening  in Greece .

            "question": "A \nWhen  milk arrived  on the doorstep  \nWhen  I was a boy growing  up in New  Jersey  in the 1960s,  we had a milkman  \ndelivering  milk to our doorstep.  His name  was Mr. Basille.  He wore  a white  cap and \ndrove  a white  truck.  As a 5-year-old  boy, I couldn’t  take my eyes off the coin changer  \nfixed  to his belt. He noticed  this one day during  a delivery  and gave  me a quarter  out \nof his coin changer.  \nOf course,  he delivered  more  than milk.  There  was cheese,  eggs and so on. If we \nneeded  to change  our order,  my mother  would  pen a note- --“Please  add a bottle  of \nbuttermilk  next delivery”- --and place  it in the box along  with the empty  bottles.  And \nthen,  the buttermilk  would  magically  appear.  \nAll of this was about  more  than convenience.  There  existed  a close  relationship  \nbetween  families  and their milkmen.  Mr. Basille  even  had a key to out house,  for \nthose  times  when  it was so cold outside  that we put the box indoors,  so that the milk \nwouldn’t  freeze.  And I remember  Mr. Basille  from  time to time taking  a break  at our \nkitchen  table,  having  a cup of tea and telling  stories  about  his delivery.  \nThere  is sadly  no home  milk delivery  today.  Big companies  allowed  the \nproduction  of cheaper  milk,  thus making  it difficult  for milkmen  to compete.  Besides,  \nmilk is for sale everywhere,  and it may just not have  been  practical  to have  a delivery  \nservice.  \nRecently,  an old milk box in the countryside  I saw brought  back  my childhood  \nmemories.  I took it home  and planted  it on the back  porch(门廊 ). Every  so often  my \nson’s  friends  will ask what  it is. So I start telling  stories  of my boyhood,  and of the \nmilkman  who brought  us friendship  along  with his milk.  \n56.

It has been  driven  out of the market.  \nC. Its service  is getting  poor.              D. It is forbidden  by law. \n59. Why  did the author  bring  back  home  an old milk box?  \nA.

Throughout  history , advertising  has \nbeen  all effective  way to promote（促进） the trading  and selling  of goods . In the \nMiddle  Ages , merchants  employed  “town  criers ” to read public  messages  aloud  to \npromote  their goods . When  printing  was invented  in the fifteenth  century , pages  of \nadvertisements  （ads）could  be printed  easily  and were  either  hung  in public  places  \nor put in books .  \nBy the end of the seventeenth  century , when  newspapers  were  beginning  to be \nread by more  people , printed  materials  became  all important  way to promote  products  \nand services .

            "question": "C \nWhile  small  may be beautiful,  tall is just plain  uncomfortable  it seems,  \nparticularly  when  it comes  to staying  in hotels  and eating  in restaurants.  \nThe Tall Persons  Club  Great  Britain  (TPCGB),  which  was formed  six months  \nago to campaign  for the needs  of the tall, has turned  its attention  to hotels  and \nrestaurants.  Beds  that are too small,  shower  heads  that are too low, and restaurant  \ntables  with hardly  any leg-room  all make  life difficult  for those  of above  average  \n  height,  it says.  \nBut it is not just the extra-tall  whose  needs  are not being  met. The average  night  \nof the population  has been  increasing  ye the standard  size of beds,  doorways,  and \nchairs  has remained  unchanged.  \n“The  bedding  industry  says a bed should  be six inches  larger  than the person  \nusing  it, so even  a king-size  bed at 6′6″(6  feet and 6 inches)  is falling  short  for 25% of \nmen,  while  the standard  6′3″ bed caters  for less than half of the male  population.”  said \nTPCGB  president  Phil Heinricy,  “seven-foot  beds would  work  fine.”  \nSimilarly,  restaurant  tables  can cause  no end of problems.  Small  tables,  which  \nmean  the long-legged  have  to sit a foot or so away  from  them,  are enough  to make  tall \ncustomers  go elsewhere.  \nSome  have  already  taken  note,  however.  At Queens  Moat  Houses′  Caledonian  \nHotel  in Edinburgh,  6′6″beds  are now put in as standard  after requests  for longer  beds \nfrom  taller  visitors,  particularly  Americans.  \n64. What  is the purpose  of the TPCGB  campaign?  \nA. To provide  better  services.             \nB. To rebuild  hotels  and restaurants.  \nC. To draw  public  attention  to the needs  of the tall.   \nD. To attract  more  people  to become  its members.  \n65. Which  of the following  might  be a bed of proper  length  according  to Phil \nHeinricy?  \nA . 7′2″        B. 7′        C. 6′6″        D. 6′3″ \n66. What  may happen  to restaurants  with small  tables?  \nA. They  may lose some  customers.                \nB. They  may start businesses  elsewhere.  \nC. They  have  to find easy chairs  to match  the tables.   \nD. They  have  to provide  enough  space  for the long-legged.  \n67. What  change  has already  been  made  in a hotel  in Edinburgh?  \nA. Tall people  pay more  for larger  beds.      \nB. 6′6″beds  have  taken  the place  of 6′3″beds.  \n  C. Special  rooms  are kept for Americans.      \nD. Guest  rooms  are standardized.\n",

The family’s  old farm  house  has become  a chicken  house,  its residents  \narriving  next month.  Last year,  Ms. Rita Gartin  kept a small  garden.  This year she has \nmade  it much  larger  because,  she said, “The  cost of everything  is going  up and I was \nlooking  to lose a few pounds  too; so it’s a win-win  situation  all around.”  \nThey  are among  the growing  number  of Americans  who,  driven  by higher  living  \ncosts  and a falling  economy  (经济 ), have  taken  up vegetable  gardening  for the first \ntime.  Others  have  increased  the size of their existing  gardens.

            "question": "B \nHoney  from  the African  forest  is not only a kind of natural  sugar,  it is also \ndelicious.  Most  people,  and many  animals,  like eating  it. However,  the only way for \nthem  to get that honey  is to find a wild bees’ nest and take the honey  from  it. Often,  \nthese  nests  are high up in trees,  and it is difficult  to find them.  In parts  of Africa,  \nthough,  people  and animals  looking  for honey  have  a strange  and unexpected  helper  \n--- a little bird called  a honey  guide.  \nThe honey  guide  does not actually  like honey,  but it does like the wax in the \nbeehives  (蜂房 ). The little bird cannot  reach  this wax,  which  is deep  inside  the bees’ \nnest. So, when  it finds  a suitable  nest, it looks  for someone  to help it. The honey  guide  \ngives  a loud cry that attracts  the attention  of both passing  animals  and people.  Once  it \nhas their attention,  it flies through  the forest,  waiting  from  time to time for the curious  \nanimal  or person  as it leads  them  to the nest. When  they finally  arrive  at the nest, the \nfollower  reaches  in to get at the delicious  honey  as the bird patiently  waits  and \nwatches.  Some  of the honey,  and the wax,  always  falls to the ground,  and this is when  \nthe honey  guide  takes  its share.  \nScientists  do not know  why the honey  guide  likes  eating  the wax,  but it is very \ndetermined  in its efforts  to get it. The birds  seem  to be able to smell  wax from  a long \ndistance  away.  They  will quickly  arrive  whenever  a beekeeper  is taking  honey  from  \nhis beehives,  and will even  enter  churches  when  beeswax  candles  are being  lit. \n60.

            "question": "D \nGrown-ups  are often  surprised  by how well they remember  something  they \nlearned  as children  but have  never  practiced  ever since.  A man who has not had a \nchance  to go swimming  for years  can still swim  as well as ever when  he gets back  in \nthe water.  He can get on a bicycle  after many  years  and still ride away.  He can play \ncatch  and hit a ball as well as his son. A mother  who has not thought  about  the words  \nfor years  can teach  her daughter  the poem  that begins  “Twinkle,  twinkle,  little star” or \nremember  the story  of Cinderella  or Goldilocks  and the Three  Bears.  \nOne explanation  is the law of overlearning , which  can be stated  as follows:  Once  \nwe have  learned  something,  additional  learning  trials  increase  the length  of time we \nwill remember  it.                                 \nIn childhood  we usually  continue  to practice  such skills  as swimming,  bicycle  \nriding,  and playing  baseball  long after we have  learned  them.  We continue  to listen  to \nand remind  ourselves  of words  such as “Twinkle,  twinkle,  little star” and childhood  \ntales such as Cinderella  and Goldilocks.  We not only learn  but overlearn.  \nThe multiplication  tables  (乘法口诀表 ) are an exception  to the general  rule that \nwe forget  rather  quickly  the things  that we learn  in school,  because  they are another  of \nthe things  we overlearn  in childhood.  \nThe law of overlearning  explains  why cramming  (突击学习 ) for an examination,  \nthough  it may result  in a passing  grade,  is not a satisfactory  way to learn  a college  \ncourse.  By cramming,  a student  may learn  the subject  well enough  to get by on the \nexamination,  but he is likely  soon  to forget  almost  everything  he learned.  A little \n  overlearning,  on the other  hand,  is really  necessary  for one’s future  development.  \n67. What  is the main  idea of Paragraph  1? \nA. People  remember  well what  they learned  in childhood.  \nB. Children  have  a better  memory  than grown-ups.  \nC. Poem  reading  is a good  way to learn  words.  \nD. Stories  for children  are easy to remember.  \n68. The author  explains  the law of overlearning  by _______.  \nA. presenting  research  findings    B. setting  down  general  rules  \nC. making  a comparison         D. using  examples  \n69. According  to the author,  being  able to use multiplication  tables  is _______.  \nA. a result  of overlearning             B. a special  case of cramming  \nC. a skill to deal with math  problems    D. a basic  step towards  advanced  studies  \n70. What  is the author ’s opinion  on cramming?  \nA. It leads  to failure  in college  exams.     B. It’s helpful  only in a limited  way.  \nC. It’s possible  to result  in poor memory.   D. It increases  students ’ learning  interest.\n",

            "question": "A \nDoctor  are known  to be terrible  pilots.  They  don’t listen  because  they already  \nknow  it all. I was lucky:  I became  a pilot in 1970,  almost  ten years  before  I graduated  \nfrom  medical  school.  I didn’t realize  then,  but becoming  a pilot makes  me a better  \nsurgeon.  I loved  flying.  As I flew bigger,  faster  planes,  and in worse  weather.  I \nlearned  about  crew  resource  management  (机组资源管理 ), or CRM,  a new idea to \nmake  flying  safer.  It means  that crew  members  should  listen  and speak  up for a good  \nresult,  regardless  of positions.  \nI first read about  CRM  in 1980.  Not long after that, an attending  doctor  and I \nwere  flying  in bad weather.  The controller  had us turn too late to get our landing  \nready.  The attending  doctor  was flying;  I was safety  pilot He was so busy  because  of \nthe bad turn, he had forgotten  to put the landing  gear (起落架 ) down.  He was a better  \npilot --- and my boss --- so it felt unusual  to speak  up. But I had to: Our lives  were  in \ndanger.  I put aside  my uneasiness  and said, “We need  to put the landing  gear down  \nnow! ” That was my first real lesson  in the power  of CRM,  and I’ve used it in the \noperating  room  ever since.  \nCRM  requires  that the pilot/surgeon  encourage  others  to speak  up. It further  \nrequires  that when  opinions  are from  the opposite,  the doctor  doesn ’t overreact,  which  \nmight  prevent  fellow  doctors  from  voicing  opinions  again.  So when  I’m in the \noperating  room,  I ask for ideas  and help from  others.  Sometimes  they’re not willing  to \nspeak  up. But I hope  that if I continue  to encourage  them,  someday  someone  will keep  \nme from  “landing  gear up”. \n56. What  dose the author  say about  doctors  in general?  \nA. They  like flying  by themselves.     B. They  are unwilling  to take advice.  \nC. They  pretend  to be good  pilots.     D. They  are quick  learners  of CRM.  \n57. The author  deepened  his understanding  of the power  of CRM  when_______.  \n  A. he saved  the plane  by speaking  up    B. he was in charge  of a flying  task \nC. his boss landed  the plane  too late     D. his boss operated  on a patient  \n58. In the last paragraph  “landing  gear up” probably  means  ______.  \nA. following  flying  requirements         B. overreacting  to different  opinions  \nC. listening  to what  fellow  doctors  say    D. making  a mistake  that may cost lives  \n59.

The idea was to reunite  Europe  after the Second  World  War.  \nAt the same  time,  the “Fringe”  appeared  as a challenge  to the official  festival.  \nEight  theatre  groups  turned  up uninvited  in 1947,  in the belief  that everyone  should  \nhave  the right  to perform,  and they did so in a public  house  disused  for years.  \nSoon,  groups  of studentsfirstly  from  Edinburgh  University,  and later from  the \nuniversities  of Oxford  and Cambridge,  Durham  and Birmingham  were  making  the \njourney  to the Scottish  capital  each summer  to perform  theatre  by little-known  writers  \nof plays  in small  church  halls  to the people  of Edinburgh.  \nToday  the “Fringe”,  once  less recognized,  has far outgrown  the festival  with \naround  1,500  performances  of theatre,  music  and dance  on every  one of the 21 days it \nlasts.

            "question": "C \nGiven  that many  people ’s moods  (情绪 ) are regulated  by the chemical  action  of \nchocolate,  it was probably  only a matter  of time before  somebody  made  the chocolate  \nshop  similar  to a drugstore  of Chinese  medicine.  Looking  like a setting  from  the film \nCharlie  & the Chocolate  Factory , Singapore ’s Chocolate  Research  Facility  (CRF)  has \nover 100 varieties  of chocolates.  Its founder  is Chris  Lee who grew  up at his parents ’ \ncorner  store  with one hand  almost  always  in the jar of sweets.  \nIf the CRF  seems  to be a smart  idea,  that’s because  Lee is not merely  a seasoned  \nsalesperson  but also head  of a marketing  department  that has business  relations  with \nbig names  such as Levi’s and Sony.  That idea surely  results  in the imagination  at \nwork  when  it comes  to making  different  flavored  (味道 ) chocolates.  \nThe CRF ’s produce  is “green ”, made  within  the country  and divided  into 10 \nlines,  with the Alcohol  Series  being  the most  popular.

            "question": "B \nThe baby  is just one day old and has not yet left hospital.  She is quiet  but alert (\n警觉 ). Twenty  centimeters  from  her face researchers  have  placed  a white  card with \ntwo black  spots  on it. She stares  at it carefully.  A researcher  removes  the card and \nreplaces  it by another,  this time with the spots  differently  spaced.  As the cards  change  \nfrom  one to the other,  her gaze (凝视 ) starts  to lose its focus  --- until a third,  with \nthree  black  spots,  is presented.  Her gaze returns;  she looks  at it for twice  as long as \nshe did at the previous  card.  Can she tell that the number  two is different  from  three,  \njust 24 hours  after coming  into the world?  \nOr do newborns  simply  prefer  more  to fewer?  The same  experiment,  but with \nthree  spots  shown  before  two, shows  the same  return  of interest  when  the number  of \nspots  changes.  Perhaps  it is just the newness?  When  slightly  older  babies  were  shown  \ncards  with pictures  of objects  (a comb,  a key, an orange  and so on), changing  the \nnumber  of objects  had an effect  separate  from  changing  the objects  themselves.

            "question": "C \nIt happened  to me recently.  I was telling  someone  how much  I had enjoyed  \nreading  Barack  Obama’s  Dreams  From  My Father  and how it had changed  my views  \nof our President.  A friend  I was talking  to agreed  with me that it was, in his words,  “a \nbrilliantly （精彩地） written  book”.  however,  he then went  on to talk abour  Mr. \nObama  in a way which  suggested  he had no idea of his background  at all. I sensed  \nthat I was talking  to a book  liar. \nAnd it seems  that my friend  is not the only one. Approximately  two thirds  of \npeople  have  lied about  reading  a book  which  they haven’t.  In the World  Book  Day’s  \n“Report  on Guilty  Secrets”,  Dreams  From  My Father  is at number  9. The report  lists \nten books,  and various  authors,  which  people  have  lied about  reading,  and as I’m not \none to lie too often  (I’d hate to be caught  out ), I’ll admit  here and now that I haven’t  \nread the entire  top ten. But I am pleased  to say that, unlike  42 percent  of peoplt,  I have  \n  read the book  at number  one, George  Orwell’s  1984.  I think  it’s really  brilliant.  \nThe World  Book  Day report  also has some  other  interesting  information  in it. It \nsays that many  people  lie about  having  read jane Austen,  Charles  Dickens,  Fyodor  \nDostoevsky  (I haven’t  read him, but haven’t  lied about  it either)and  Herman  Melville.  \nAsked  why they lied, the most  common  reason  was to “impress”  someone  they \nwere  speaking  to. This coule  be tricky  if the conversation  became  more  in – depth!  \nBut when  asked  which  authors  they actually  enjoy,  people  named  J.k. Rowling,  \nJohn  Grisham,  Sophie  Kinsella  (ah, the big sellers,  in other  words).  Forty-two  percent  \nof people  asked  admitted  they turned  to the back  of the book  to read the end before  \nfinishing  the story  (I’ll come  clean:  I do this and am astonished  that 58 percent  said \nthey had never  dome  so). \n64.

            "question": "B \nPassenger  pigeons（ 旅 鸽 ） once  flew over much  of the United  States  in \nunbelievable  numbers.  Written  accounts  from  the 18th and 19th centuries  described  \nflocks（群） so large  that they darkened  the sky for hours.  \nIt was calculated  that when  its population  reach  its highest  point,  there  were  \nmore  than 3 billion  passenger  pigeons  – a number  equal  to 24 to 40 percent  of the \ntotal bird population  in the United  States,  making  it perhaps  the most  abundant  birds  \nin the world.  Even  as late as 1870  when  their numbers  had already  become  smaller,  a \nflock  believed  to be 1 mile wide  and 320 miles  (about  515 kilometers)  long was seen \nnear Cincinnati.  \nSadly,  the abundance  of passenger  pigeons  may have  been  their undoing . Where  \nthe birds  were  abundant,  people  believed  there  was an ever-lasting  supply  and killed  \nthem  by the thousands.  Commercial  hunters  attracted  them  to small  clearings  with \ngrain,  waited  until pigeons  had settled  to feed,  then threw  large  nets over them,  taking  \nhundreds  at a time.  The birds  were  shipped  to large  cities  and sold in restaurants.  \nBy the closing  decades  of the 19th century,  the hardwood  forests  where  \npassenger  pigeons  nested  had been  damaged  by Americans’  need  for wood,  which  \nscattered（驱散） the flocks  and forced  the birds  to go farther  north,  where  cold \ntemperatures  and spring  storms  contributed  to their decline.  Soon  the great  flocks  \nwere  gone,  never  to be seen again.  \nIn 1897,  the state of Michigan  passed  a law prohibiting  the killing  of passenger  \npigeons,  but by then,  no sizable  flocks  had been  seen in the state for 10 years.  The last \nconfirmed  wild pigeon  in the United  States  was shot by a boy in Pike County,  Ohio,  \nin 1900.  For a time,  a few birds  survived  under  human  care.

In fact, half of the \n6,000-7,000  languages  spoken  around  the world  today  will likely  die out by the next \ncentury,  according  to the United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and Cultural  \nOrganization  (UNESCO).   \nIn an effort  to prevent  language  loss, scholars  from  a number  of organizations- -- \nUNESCO  and National  Geographic  among  them ---have  for many  years  been  \ndocumenting  dying  languages  and the cultures  they reflect.  \nMark  Turin,  a scientist  at the Macmillan  Center,  Yale  University,  who \nspecializes  in the languages  and oral traditions  of the Himalayas,  is following  in that \n  tradition . His recently  published  book,  A Grammar  of Thangmi  with an \nEthnolinguistic  Introduction  to the Speakers  and Their  Culture , grows  out of his \nexperience  living,  looking  and raising  a family  in a village  in Nepal.  \nDocumenting  the Tangmi  language  and culture  is just a starting  point  for Turin,  \nwho seeks  to include  other  languages  and oral traditions  across  the Himalayans  \nreaches  of India,  Nepal,  Bhutan,  and China.  But he is not content  to simply  record  \nthese  voices  before  they disappear  without  record.  \nAt the University  of Cambridge  Turin  discovered  a wealth  of important  \nmaterials ---including  photographs,  films,  tap recordings,  and field notes- --which  had \nremained  unstudied  and were  badly  in need  of care and protection.  \nNow,  through  the two organizations  that he has founded- --the Digital  Himalaya  \nProject  and the World  Oral Literature  Project- --Turin  has started  a campaign  to make  \nsuch documents,  found  in libraries  and stores  around  the world,  available  not just to \nscholars  but to the youngers.  \nGenerations  of communities  from  whom  the materials  were  originally  collected.  \nThanks  to digital  technology  and the widely  available  Internet.

I left for the land of warmth  and vitamin  C (维生素\nC), thinking  of beaches  and orange  trees.  When  we touched  down  to blue skies  and \nwarm  air, I sent up a small  prayer  of gratefulness.  Swimming  pools,  wine  tasting,  and \npink sunsets  (at normal  evening  hours,  not 4 in the afternoon)  filled  the weekend,  but \nthe best part — particularly  to my taste,  dulled  by months  of cold — weather  root \nvegetables  — was a 7 a.m. adventure  to the Sarasota  farmers’  market  that proved  to \nbe more  than worth  the early  wake-up  call. \nThe market,  which  was founded  in 1979,  sets up its tents  every  Saturday  from  7 \na.m. to 1 p.m.,  rain or shine,  along  North  Lemon  and State  streets.  Baskets  of perfect  \n  red strawberries,  the red-painted  sides  of the Java Dawg  coffee  truck;  and most  of all, \nthe tomatoes:  amazing,  large,  soft and round  red tomatoes.  \nDisappointed  by many  a broken,  vine-ripened  (蔓上成熟的 ) promise,  I’ve \nrefused  to buy winter  tomatoes  for years.  No matter  how attractive  they look in the \nstore,  once  I get them  home  they’re  unfailingly  dry, hard,  and tasteless.  But I homed  \nin, with uncertainty,  on one particular  table  at the Brown’s  Grove  Farm’s  stand,  full of \nfresh  and soft tomatoes  the size of my fist. These  were  the real deal — and at that \nmoment,  I realized  that the best part of Sarasota  in winter  was going  to be eating  \nthings  that back  home  in New  York  I wouldn’t  be experiencing  again  for months.  \nDelighted  as I was by the tomatoes  in sight,  my happiness  deepened  when  I \nlearned  that Brown’s  Grove  Farm  is one of the suppliers  for Jack Dusty,  a newly  \nopened  restaurant  at the Sarasota  Ritz Carlton,  where  — luckily  for me — I was \nplanning  to have  dinner  that very night.  Without  even  seeing  the menu,  I knew  I’d be \nordering  every  tomato  on it. \n24. What  did the author  think  of her winter  life in New  York?  \nA. Exciting.     B. Boring.       C.

            "question": "D \nConflict  is on the menu  tonight  at the café La Chope.  This evening,  as on every  \n  Thursday  night,  psychologist  Maud  Lehanne  is leading  two of France’s  favorite  \npastimes,  coffee  drinking  and the “talking  cure”. Here  they are learning  to get in touch  \nwith their true feelings.  It isn’t always  easy.  The customers  — some  thirty  Parisians  \nwho pay just under  $2 (plus  drinks)  per session  — care quick  to intellectualize  (高谈\n阔论 ), slow  to open  up and connect.  “You are forbidden  to say ‘one feels’  or ‘people  \nthink’ ” Lehanne  told them.  “Say ‘I think,’  ‘Think  me’.”  \nA café society  where  no intellectualizing  is allowed?  It couldn’t  seem  more  \nun-French.  But Lehanne’s  psychology  café is about  more  than knowing  oneself:  It’s \ntrying  to help the city’s  troubled  neighborhood  cafes.  Over  the years,  Parisian  cafes  \nhave  fallen  victim  to changes  in the French  lifestyle  — longer  working  hours,  a fast \nfood boom  and a younger  generation’s  desire  to spend  more  time at home.  Dozens  of \nnew theme  cafes  appear  to change  the situation.  Cafes  focused  around  psychology,  \nhistory,  and engineering  are catching  on, filling  tables  well into the evening.  \nThe city’s  “psychology  cafes ”, which  offer  great  comfort,  are among  the most  \npopular  places.  Middle-aged  homemakers,  retirees,  and the unemployed  come  to such \ncafes  to talk about  love,  anger,  and dreams  with a psychologist.  And they come  to \nLehanne’s  group  just to learn  to say what  they feel. “There’s  a strong  need  in Paris  for \ncommunication, ” says Maurice  Frisch,  a café La Chope  regular  who works  as a \nreligious  instructor  in a nearby  church.  “People  have  few real friends.  And they need  \nto open  up”. Lehanne  says she’d  like to see psychology  cafes  all over France.  “If \npeople  had normal  lives,  these  cafes  wouldn’t  exist, ” she says.  “If life weren’t  a battle,  \npeople  wouldn’t  need  a special  place  just to speak. ” But then,  it wouldn’t  be France.    \n32. What  are people  encouraged  to do at the cafe La Chope?   \nA. Learn  a new subject.    B. Keep  in touch  with friends.   \nC. Show  off their knowledge.   D. Express  their true feelings.   \n33. How  are cafes  affected  by French  lifestyle  changes?   \nA. They  are less frequently  visited.   B. They  stay open  for longer  hours.   \nC. They  have  bigger  night  crowds.   D. They  start to serve  fast food.   \n34. What  are theme  cafes  expected  to do?  \nA. Create  more  jobs.    B. Supply  better  drinks.   \n  C. Save  the cafe business.   D. Serve  the neighborhood.   \n35. Why  are psychology  cafes  becoming  popular  in Paris?   \nA. They  bring  people  true friendship.    \nB. They  give people  spiritual  support.   \nC.

            "question": "A \nMy color  television  has given  me nothing  but a headache.  I was able to buy it a \nlittle over a year ago because  I had my relatives  give me money  for my birthday  \ninstead  of a lot of clothes  that wouldn’t  fit. I let a salesclerk  fool me into buying  a \ndiscontinued  model.  I realized  this a day late, when  I saw newspaper  advertisements  \nfor the set at seventy-five  dollars  less than I had paid.  The set worked  so beautifully  \nwhen  I first got it home  that I would  keep  it on until stations  signed  off for the night.  \nFortunately,  I didn’t  got any channels  showing  all-night  movies  or I would  never  have  \ngotten  to bed. \nThen  I started  developing  a problem  with the set that involved  static  (静电 ) \nnoise.  For some  reason,  when  certain  shows  switched  into a commercial,  a loud noise  \nwould  sound  for a few seconds.  Gradually,  this noise  began  to appear  during  a show,  \nand to get rid of it, I had to change  to another  channel  and then change  it back.  \nSometimes  this technique  would  not work,  and I had to pick up the set and shake  it to \nremove  the sound.  I actually  began  to build  up my arm muscles  (肌肉 ) shaking  my \nset. \nWhen  neither  of these  methods  removed  the static  noise,  I would  sit helplessly  \nand wait for the noise  to go away.  At last I ended  up hitting  the set with my fist, and it \nstopped  working  altogether.  My trip to the repair  shop  cost me $62, and the set is \nworking  well now,  but I keep  expecting  more  trouble.  \n21. Why  did the author  say he was fooled  into buying  the TV set? \nA. He got an older  model  than he had expected.  \nB. He couldn’t  return  it when  it was broken.  \nC. He could  have  bought  it at a lower  price.  \n  D.

            "question": "B \nYour  house  may have  an effect  on your figure.  Experts  say the way you design  \nyour home  could  play a role in whether  you pack  on the pounds  or keep  them  off. You \ncan make  your environment  work  for you instead  of against  you. Here  are some  ways  \nto turn your home  into part of diet plan.  \nOpen  the curtains  and turn up the lights.  Dark  environments  are more  likely  to \nencourage  overeating,  for people  are often  less self-conscious （难为情） when  \nthey’re  in poorly  lit places-and  so more  likely  to eat lots of food.  If your home  doesn’t  \nhave  enough  window  light,  get more  lamps  and flood  the place  with brightness.  \nMind  the colors.  Research  suggests  warm  colors  fuel our appetites.  In one study,  \npeople  who ate meals  in a blue room  consumed  33 percent  less than those  in a yellow  \nor red room.  Warm  colors  like yellow  make  food appear  more  appetizing,  while  cold \ncolors  make  us feel less hungry.  So when  it’s time to repaint,  go blue.  \nDon’t  forget  the clock—or the radio.  People  who eat slowly  tend to consume  \nabout  70 fewer  calories（卡路里） per meal  than those  who rush through  their meals.  \nBegin  keeping  track  of the time,  and try to make  dinner  last at least 30 minutes,  And \nwhile  you’re  at it, actually  sit down  to eat. If you need  some  help slowing  down,  turn \non relaxing  music.  It makes  you less likely  to rush through  a meal.  \nDownsize  the dishes,  Big serving  bowls  and plates  can easily  make  us fat. We \neat about  22 percent  more  when  using  a 12-inch  plate  instead  of a 10-inch  plate.  \n  When  we choose  a large  spoon  over a smaller  one ,total  intake（摄入）  jumps  by 14 \npercent.  And we’ll  pour about  30 percent  more  liquid  into a short,  wide  glass  than a \ntall, skinny  glass.  \n25.

            "question": "C \nMore  student  than ever before  are taking  a gap-year  (间隔年 ) before  going  to \nuniversity.  It used to be called  the “year  off” between  school  and university.  The \ngap-year  phenomenon  originated  (起源 ) with the months  left over to Oxbridge  \napplicants  between  entrance  exams  in November  and the start of the next academic  \nyear.  \nThis year,  25,310  students  who have  accepted  places  in higher  education  \ninstitutions  have  put off their entry  until next year,  according  to statistics  on university  \nentrance  provided  by University  and College  Admissions  Service  (UCAS).  \nThat is a record  14.7%  increase  in the number  of students  taking  a gap year.  \nTony  Higgins  from  UCAS  said that the statistics  are good  news  for everyone  in higher  \neducation.  “Students  who take a well-planned  year out are more  likely  to be satisfied  \nwith,  and complete,  their chosen  course.  Students  who take a gap year are often  more  \nmature  and responsible,”  he said. \n  But not everyone  is happy.  Owain  James,  the president  of the National  Union  of \nStudents  (NUS),  argued  that the increase  is evidence  of student  had ship — young  \npeople  are being  forced  into earning  money  before  finishing  their education.  “New  \nstudents  are now aware  that they are likely  to leave  university  up to ￡15,000  in debt.  \nIt is not surprising  that more  and more  students  are taking  a gap year to earn money  to \nsupport  their study  for the degree.  NUS  statistics  show  that over 40% of students  are  \nforced  to work  during  term time and the figure  increases  to 90% during  vacation  \nperiods,”  he said. \n29. What  do we learn  about  the gap year from  the text?  \nA. It is flexible  in length.        B. It is a time for relaxation.  \nC. It is increasingly  popular.     D. It is required  by universities.  \n30.

How  does Owain  James  feel about  the gap-year  phenomenon?  \nA. He’s puzzled.   B. He’s worried.   C. He’s surprised.   D. He’s annoyed.  \n32. What  would  most  students  do on their vacation  according  to NUS  statistics?  \nA. Attend  additional  courses.         B. Make  plans  for the new term.  \nC.

            "question": "B \nGrandparents  Answer  a Call \nAs a third-generation  native  of Brownsville,  Texas,  Mildred  Garza  never  planned  \nto move  away.  Even  when  her daughter  and son asked  her to move  to San Antonio  to \nhelp with their children,  she politely  refused.  Only  after a year of friendly  discussion  \ndid Ms. Garza  finally  say yes. That was four years  ago. Today  all three  generations  \nregard  the move  as a success,  giving  them  a closer  relationship  than they would  have  \nhad in separate  cities.  \nNo statistics  show  the number  of grandparents  like Garza  who are moving  closer  \nto adult  children  and grandchildren.  Yet there  is evidence  suggesting  that the trend  is \n  growing.  Even  President  Obama’s  mother-in-law,  Marian  Robinson,  has agreed  to \nleave  Chicago  and move  into the White  House  to help care for her granddaughters.  \nAccording  to a study  by grandparents.com,  83 percent  of the people  said Mrs. \nRobinson’s  decision  will influence  grandparents  in the American  family.  Two-thirds  \nbelieve  more  families  will follow  the example  of Obama’s  family.  \n“In the 1960s  we were  all a little wild and couldn’t  get away  from  home  far \nenough  or fast enough  to prove  we could  do it on our own,”  says Christine  Crosby,  \npublisher  of Grand , a magazine  for grandparents.  “We now realize  how important  \nfamily  is and how important  it is to be near them,  especially  when  you’re  raising  \nchildren.”  \nMoving  is not for everyone.  Almost  every  grandparent  wants  to be with his or \nher grandchildren  and is willing  to make  sacrifices,  but sometimes  it is wiser  to say no \nand visit frequently  instead.  Having  your grandchildren  far away  is hard,  especially  \nknowing  your adult  child  is struggling,  but giving  up the life you know  may be \nharder.  \n25. Why  was Garza’s  move  a success?  \nA. It strengthened  her family  ties. \nB. It improved  her living  conditions.  \nC. It enabled  her make  more  friends.  \nD. It helped  her know  more  new places.  \n26. What  was the reaction  of the public  to Mrs. Robinson’s  decision?  \nA. 17% expressed  their support  for it. \nB. Few people  responded  sympathetically.  \nC. 83% believed  it had a bad influence.  \nD. The majority  thought  it was a trend.  \n27. What  did Crosby  say about  people  in the 1960s?  \nA. They  were  unsure  of themselves.  \nB. They  were  eager  to raise  more  children.  \nC. They  wanted  to live away  from  their parents.  \nD. They  had little respect  for their grandparents.  \n  28. What  does the author  suggest  the grandparents  do in the last paragraph?  \nA.

            "question": "D \nThe meaning  of silence  varies  among  cultural  groups.  Silences  may be \nthoughtful,  or they may be empty  when  a person  has nothing  to say. A silence  in a \nconversation  may also show  stubbornness,  uneasiness,  or worry.  Silence  may be \nviewed  by some  cultural  groups  as extremely  uncomfortable;  therefore  attempts  may \nbe made  to fill every  gap (间隙 ) with conversation.  Persons  in other  cultural  groups  \nvalue  silence  and view  it as necessary  for understanding  a person’s  needs.   \nMany  Native  Americans  value  silence  and feel it is a basic  part of \ncommunicating  among  people,  just as some  traditional  Chinese  and Thai persons  do. \nTherefore,  when  a person  from  one of these  cultures  is speaking  and suddenly  stops,  \nwhat  maybe  implied  (暗示 ) is that the person  wants  the listener  to consider  what  has \nbeen  said before  continuing.  In these  cultures,  silence  is a call for reflection.  \nOther  cultures  may use silence  in other  ways,  particularly  when  dealing  with \nconflicts  among  people  or in relationships  of people  with different  amounts  of power.  \nFor example,  Russian,  French,  and Spanish  persons  may use silence  to show  \nagreement  between  parties  about  the topic  under  discussion.  However,  Mexicans  may \nuse silence  when  instructions  are given  by a person  in authority  rather  than be rude to \nthat person  by arguing  with him or her. In still another  use, persons  in Asian  cultures  \nmay view  silence  as a sign of respect,  particularly  to an elder  or a person  in authority.  \nNurses  and other  care-givers  need  to be aware  of the possible  meanings  of \nsilence  when  they come  across  the personal  anxiety  their patients  may be \nexperiencing.  Nurses  should  recognize  their own personal  and cultural  construction  of \nsilence  so that a patient’s  silence  is not interrupted  too early  or allowed  to go on \nunnecessarily.  A nurse  who understands  the healing  (治愈 ) value  of silence  can use \nthis understanding  to assist  in the care of patients  from  their own and from  other  \n  cultures.  \n32. What  does the author  say about  silence  in conversations?  \nA. It implies  anger.              B. It promotes  friendship.  \nC. It is culture-specific.           D. It is content-based.  \n33. Which  of the following  people  might  regard  silence  as a call for careful  thought?  \nA. The Chinese.     B. The French.     C. The Mexicans.    D. The Russians.  \n34. What  does the author  advise  nurses  to do about  silence?  \nA. Let it continue  as the patient  pleases.     B. Break  it while  treating  patients.  \nC. Evaluate  its harm  to patients.         D. Make  use of its healing  effects.  \n35. What  may be the best title for the text?  \nA. Sound  and Silence               B. What  It Means  to Be Silent  \nC. Silence  to Native  Americans       D. Speech  Is Silver;  Silence  Is Gold\n",

            "question": "B \nFive years  ago, when  I taught  art at a school  in Seattle,  I used Tinkertoys  as a test \nat the beginning  of a term to find out something  about  my students.  I put a small  set of \nTinkertoys  in front  of each student,  and said:  “Make  something  out of the Tinkertoys.  \nYou have  45 minutes  today  ― and 45 minutes  each day for the rest of the week.”  \nA few students  hesitated  to start.  They  waited  to see what  the rest of the class  \nwould  do. Several  others  checked  the instructions  and made  something  according  to \none of the model  plans  provided.  Another  group  built something  out of their own \nimaginations.  \n  Once  I had a boy who worked  experimentally  with Tinkertoys  in his free time.  \nHis constructions  filled  a shelf  in the art classroom  and a good  part of his bedroom  at \nhome.  I was delighted  at the presence  of such a student.  Here  was an exceptionally  \ncreative  mind  at work.  His presence  meant  that I had an unexpected  teaching  assistant  \nin class  whose  creativity  would  infect  (感染 ) other  students.  \nEncouraging  this kind of thinking  has a downside . I ran the risk of losing  those  \nstudents  who had a different  style  of thinking.  Without  fail one would  declare,  “But  \nI’m just not creative.”  \n“Do you dream  at night  when  you’re  asleep?”  \n“Oh,  sure.”  \n“So tell me one of your most  interesting  dreams.”  The student  would  tell \nsomething  wildly  imaginative.  Flying  in the sky or in a time machine  or growing  three  \nheads.  “That’s  pretty  creative.  Who  does that for you?”  \n“Nobody.  I do it.” \n“Really  ― at night,  when  you’re  asleep?”  \n“Sure.”  \n“Try  doing  it in the daytime,  in class,  okay?”  \n25. The teacher  used Tinkertoys  in class  in order  to ________?  \nA. know  more  about  the students     B. make  the lessons  more  exciting  \nC. raise  the students’  interest  in art   D. teach  the students  about  toy design  \n26. What  do we know  about  the boy mentioned  in Paragraph  3? \nA. He liked  to help his teacher.      B. He preferred  to study  alone.  \nC. He was active  in class.           D.

Now,  the website  \nBookCrossing.com  turns  the page  on the traditional  idea of a book  group.  \nMembers  go on the site and register  the books  they own and would  like to share.  \nBookCrossing  provides  an identification  number  to stick  inside  the book.

In fact, they were  shot from  \n1914  through  1916,  most  of them  after a disastrous  shipwreck  (海 难 ), by a \ncameraman  who had no reasonable  expectation  of survival.  Many  of the images  were  \nstored  in an ice chest,  under  freezing  water,  in the damaged  wooden  ship.  \nThe ship was the Endurance , a small,  tight,  Norwegian-built  three-master  that \nwas intended  to take Sir Ernest  Shackleton  and a small  crew  of seamen  and scientists,  \n27 men in all, to the southernmost  shore  of Antarctica’s  Weddell  Sea. From  that point  \nShackleton  wanted  to force  a passage  by dog sled (雪橇 ) across  the continent.  The \njourney  was intended  to achieve  more  than what  Captain  Robert  Falcon  Scott  had \ndone.  Captain  Scott  had reached  the South  Pole early  in 1912  but had died with his \nfour companions  on the march  back.  \nAs writer  Caroline  Alexander  makes  clear  in her forceful  and well-researched  \nstory  The Endurance , adventuring  was even  then a thoroughly  commercial  effort.  \nScott’s  last journey,  completed  as he lay in a tent dying  of cold and hunger,  caught  the \nworld’s  imagination,  and a film made  in his honor  drew  crowds.  Shackleton,  a \nonetime  British  merchant-navy  officer  who had got to within  100 miles  of the South  \nPole in 1908,  started  a business  before  his 1914  voyage  to make  money  from  movie  \nand still photography.  Frank  Hurley,  a confident  and gifted  Australian  photographer  \nwho knew  the Antarctic,  was hired  to make  the images,  most  of which  have  never  \nbefore  been  published.  \n33.

They  recorded  a disastrous  adventure.  \n34. Who  reached  the South  Pole first according  to the text?  \nA. Frank  Hurley.             B. Ernest  Shackleton.  \nC. Robert  Falcon  Scott.        D. Caroline  Alexander.  \n35. What  does Alexander  think  was the purpose  of the 1914  voyage?  \nA. Artistic  creation.        B. Scientific  research.  \nC. Money  making.         D.

They settled in at a comfortable East Side cafe and within minutes, another customer was approaching their table.\n“Hey, aren’t you from Mississippi?” the elegant, white-haired writer remembered being asked by the stranger. “I’m from Mississippi too.”\n   Without a second thought, the woman joined the Welty party. When her dinner partner showed up, she also pulled up a chair.\n“They began telling me all the news of Mississippi,” Welty said. “I didn’t know what my New York friends were thinking.”\n    Taxis on a rainy New York night are rarer than sunshine. By the time the group got up to leave, it was pouring outside. Welty’s new friends immediately sent a waiter to find a cab. Heading back downtown toward her hotel, her big-city friends were amazed at the turn of events that had changed their Big Apple dinner into a Mississippi state reunion (团聚).\n“My friends said: ‘Now we believe your stories,’” Welty added. “And I said: ‘Now you know. These are the people that make me write them.’”\nSitting on a sofa in her room, Welty, a slim figure in a simple gray dress, looked pleased with this explanation.\n“I don’t make them up,” she said of the characters in her fiction these last 50 or so years. “I don’t have to.”\nBeauticians, bartenders, piano players and people with purple hats, Welty’s people come from afternoons spent visiting with old friends, from walks through the streets of her native Jackson, Miss., from conversations overheard on a bus. It annoys Welty that, at 78, her left ear has now given out. Sometimes, sitting on a bus or a train, she hears only a fragment (片段) of a particularly interesting story.\n25. What happened when Welty was with her friends at the cafe?\nA. Two strangers joined her.         B. Her childhood friends came in.\n  C. A heavy rain ruined the dinner.     D. Some people held a party there.\n26. The underlined word “them” in Paragraph 6 refers to Welty’s        .\nA. readers     \tB. parties     \tC. friends   \tD. stories\n27.

They are pleasure seekers.\n",

            "question": "C\nIf you are a fruit grower — or would like to become one — take advantage of Apple Day to see what’s around. It’s called Apple Day but in practice it’s more like Apple Month. The day itself is on October 21, but since it has caught on, events now spread out over most of October around Britain.\nVisiting an apple event is a good chance to see, and often taste, a wide variety of apples. To people who are used to the limited choice of apples such as Golden Delicious and Royal Gala in supermarkets, it can be quite an eye opener to see the range of classical apples still in existence, such as Decio which was grown by the Romans. Although it doesn’t taste of anything special, it’s still worth a try, as is the knobbly (多疙瘩的) Cat’s Head which is more of a curiosity than anything else.\nThere are also varieties developed to suit specific local conditions. One of the very best varieties for eating quality is Orleans Reinette, but you’ll need a warm, sheltered place with perfect soil to grow it, so it’s a pipe dream for most apple lovers who fall for it.\nAt the events, you can meet expert growers and discuss which ones will best suit your conditions, and because these are family affairs, children are well catered for with apple-themed fun and games.\nApple Days are being held at all sorts of places with an interest in fruit, including stately gardens and commercial orchards (果园). If you want to have a real orchard experience, try visiting the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale, near Faversham in Kent.\n28. What can people do at the apple events?\nA. Attend experts’ lectures.             \tB. Visit fruit-loving families.\nC. Plant fruit trees in an orchard.     \t\tD. Taste many kinds of apples.\n29. What can we learn about Decio?\nA. It is a new variety.                \tB. It has a strange look.\nC. It is rarely seen now.               \tD. It has a special taste.\n30. What does the underlined phrase “a pipe dream” in Paragraph 3 mean?\nA. A practical idea.  \tB. A vain hope.  C. A brilliant plan.  D. A selfish desire.\n31. What is the author’s purpose in writing the text?\nA. To show how to grow apples.      B. To introduce an apple festival.\nC. To help people select apples.       D. To promote apple research.\n",

            "question": "D\nBad news sells. If it bleeds, it leads. No news is good news, and good news is no news. Those are the classic rules for the evening broadcasts and the morning papers. But now that information is being spread and monitored (监控) in different ways, researchers are discovering new rules. By tracking people’s e-mails and online posts, scientists have found that good news can spread faster and farther than disasters and sob stories.\n   “The ‘if it bleeds’ rule works for mass media,” says Jonah Berger, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. “They want your eyeballs and don’t care how you’re feeling. But when you share a story with your friends, you care a lot more how they react. You don’t want them to think of you as a Debbie Downer.”\n   Researchers analyzing word-of-mouth communication — e-mails, Web posts and reviews, face-to-face conversations — found that it tended to be more positive than negative (消极的), but that didn’t necessarily mean people preferred positive news. Was positive news shared more often simply because people experienced more good things than bad things? To test for that possibility, Dr. Berger looked at how people spread a particular set of news stories: thousands of articles on The New York Times’ website. He and a Penn colleague analyzed the “most e-mailed” list for six months. One of his first findings was that articles in the science section were much more likely to make the list than non-science articles. He found that science amazed Times’ readers and made them want to share this positive feeling with others.\nReaders also tended to share articles that were exciting or funny, or that inspired negative feelings like anger or anxiety, but not articles that left them merely sad. They needed to be aroused (激发) one way or the other, and they preferred good news to bad. The more positive an article, the more likely it was to be shared, as Dr. Berger explains in his new book, “Contagious: Why Things Catch On.” \n32. What do the classic rules mentioned in the text apply to?\nA. News reports.    \t    B. Research papers.  \t\t\nC. Private e-mails.    \tD. Daily conversations.\n33. What can we infer about people like Debbie Downer?\nA. They’re socially inactive.        B. They’re good at telling stories.\nC. They’re inconsiderate of others.   D. They’re careful with their words.\n34. Which tended to be the most e-mailed according to Dr. Berger’s research?\nA. Sports news.      \t  B. Science articles.    \t\t\nC. Personal accounts.  \t  D. Financial reviews.\n35. What can be a suitable title for the text?\nA. Sad Stories Travel Far and Wide       \nB .Online News Attracts More People\nC.

Trying  to help injured,  displaced  or sick creatures  \ncan be heartbreaking;  survival  is never  certain.  However,  when  it works,  it is simply  \nbeautiful.  \n I got a rescue  call from  a woman  in Muttontown.  She had found  a young  owl (猫\n头鹰 ) on the ground.  When  I arrived,  I saw a 2-to 3-week-old  owl. It had already  been  \nplaced  in a carrier  for safety.  \n I examined  the chick  (雏鸟 ) and it seemed  fine. If I could  locate  the nest, I might  \nhave  been  able to put it back,  but no luck.  My next work  was to construct  a nest and \nanchor  it in a tree. \n The homeowner  was very helpful.  A wire basket  was found.  I put some  pine \nbranches  into the basket  to make  this nest safe and comfortable.  I placed  the chick  in \nthe nest, and it quickly  calmed  down.  \n Now  all that was needed  were  the parents,  but they were  absent.  I gave  the \nhomeowner  a recording  of the hunger  screams  of owl chicks.  These  advertise  the \npresence  of chicks  to adults;  they might  also encourage  our chick  to start calling  as \nwell.

            "question": "C \nSome  of the world’s  most  famous  musicians  recently  gathered  in Paris  and New  \nOrleans  to celebrate  the first annual  International  Jazz Day.  UNESCO(  United  \nNations  Educational,  Scientific  and Cultural  Organization)  recently  set April  30 as a \nday to raise  awareness  of jazz music,  its significance,  and its potential  as a unifying  (\n联合 ) voice  across  cultures.  \nDespite  the celebrations,  though,  in the U.S. the jazz audience  continues  to \nshrink  and grow  older,  and the music  has failed  to connect  with younger  generations.  \nIt’s Jason  Moran’s  job to help change  that. As the Kennedy  Center’s  artistic  \nadviser  for jazz, Moran  hopes  to widen  the audience  for jazz, make  the music  more  \naccessible,  and preserve  its history  and culture.  \n“Jazz  seems  like it’s not really  a part of the American  appetite,”  Moran  tells \nNational  Public  Radio’s  reporter  Neal  Conan.  “What  I’m hoping  to accomplish  is that \nmy generation  and younger  start to reconsider  and understand  that jazz is not black  \nand write  anymore.  It’s actually  color,  and it’s actually  digital.”  \n  Moran  says one of the problems  with jazz today  is that the entertainment  aspect  \nof the music  has been  lost. “The  music  can’t  be presented  today  the way it was in \n1908  or 1958.  It has to continue  to move,  because  the way the world  works  is not the \nsame,”  says Moran.  \nLast year,  Moran  worked  on a project  that arranged  Fats Waller’s  music  for a \ndance  party,  “Just  to kind of put it back  in the mind  that Waller  is dance  music  as \nmuch  as it is concert  music,”  says Moran.  “For me, it’s the recontextualization.  In \nmusic,  where  does the emotion  (情感 ) lie? Are we, as humans,  gaining  any insight  (\n感悟 ) on how to talk about  ourselves  and how something  as abstract  as a Charlie  \nParker  record  gets us into a dialogue  about  our emotions  and our thoughts?  \nSometimes  we lose sight  that the music  has a wider  context,”  says Moran,  “so I want  \nto continue  those  dialogues.  Those  are the things  I want  to foster.”  \n28. Why  did UNESCO  set April  30 as International  Jazz Day?  \nA. To remember  the birth  of jazz. \nB. To protect  cultural  diversity.  \nC. To encourage  people  to study  music.  \nD. To recognize  the value  of jazz. \n29. What  does the underlined  word  “that”  in paragraph  3 refer  to? \nA. Jazz becoming  more  accessible.  \nB. The production  of jazz growing  faster.  \nC. Jazz being  less popular  with the young.  \nD. The jazz audience  becoming  larger.   \n30. What  can we infer  about  Moran’s  opinion  on jazz?  \nA. It will disappear  gradually.          B. It remains  black  and white.  \nC. It should  keep  up with the times.     D. It changes  every  50 years.  \n31. Which  of the following  can be the best title for the text?  \nA. Exploring  the Future  of Jazz.     B. The Rise and Fall of Jazz.  \nC. The Story  of a Jazz Musician.     D.

Developed  by two doctors  in \nthe U.S. Department  of Agriculture,  it’s an excellent  water  collector.  Unfortunately,  \nyou must  carry  the necessary  equipment  with you, since  it’s all but impossible  to find \nnatural  substitutes.  The only components  required,  though,  are a 5'×5'  sheet  of clear  or \nslightly  milky  plastic,  six feet of plastic  tube,  and a container  — perhaps  just a \ndrinking  cup — to catch  the water.  These  pieces  can be folded  into a neat little pack  \nand fastened  on your belt. \n    To construct  a working  still, use a sharp  stick  or rock to dig a hole four feet \nacross  and three  feet deep.  Try to make  the hole in a damp  area to increase  the water  \ncatcher’s  productivity.  Place  your cup in the deepest  part of the hole.  Then  lay the \ntube in place  so that one end rests all the way in the cup and the rest of the line runs \nup — and out — the side of the hole.  \nNext,  cover  the hole with the plastic  sheet,  securing  the edges  of the plastic  with \ndirt and weighting  the sheet’s  center  down  with a rock.

When  the studio  \ndidn’t  want  me for the film — it wanted  somebody  as well known  as Paul — he stood  \nup for me. I don’t  know  how many  people  would  have  done  that; they would  have  \nlistened  to their agents  or the studio  powers.  \nThe friendship  that grew  out of the experience  of making  that film and The Sting  \nfour years  later had its root in the fact that although  there  was an age difference,  we \nboth came  from  a tradition  of theater  and live TV. We were  respectful  of craft（技艺\n）and focused  on digging  into the characters  we were  going  to play.  Both  of us had \nthe qualities  and virtues  that are typical  of American  actors:  humorous,  aggressive,  \nand making  fun of each other  — but always  with an underlying  affection.  Those  were  \nalso at the core（核心） of our relationship  off the screen.  \nWe shared  the brief  that if you’re  fortunate  enough  to have  success,  you should  \n  put something  back  — he with his Newman’s  Own  food and his Hole  in the Wall  \ncamps  for kids who are seriously  ill, and me with Sundance  and the institute  and the \nfestival.  Paul and I didn’t  see each other  all that regularly,  but sharing  that brought  us \ntogether.

Why  was the studio  unwilling  to give the role to author  at first?  \nA. Paul Newman  wanted  it.        B. The studio  powers  didn’t  like his agent.  \nC. He wasn’t  famous  enough.       D. The director  recommended  someone  else. \n25. Why  did Paul and the author  have  a lasting  friendship?  \nA. They  were  of the same  age.       B. They  worked  in the same  theater.  \nC.

The Transition,  which  flew at 1,400  feet for eight  \nminutes  last month,  can reach  around  70 miles  per hour on the road and 115 in the air. \nIt flies using  a 23-gallon  tank of gas and bums  5 gallons  per hour in the air. On the \nground,  it gets 35 miles  per gallon.  \nAround  100 people  have  already  put down  a $10,000  deposit  to get a Transition  \nwhen  they go on sale, and those  numbers  will likely  rise after Terrafugia  introduces  \n  the Transition  to the public  later this week  at the New  York  Auto  Show.  But don’t  \nexpect  it to show  up in too many  driveways.  It’s expected  to cost $279,000.  And it \nwon’t  help if you’re  stuck  in traffic.  The car needs  a runway.  \nInventors  have  been  trying  to make  flying  cars since  the 1930s,  according  to \nRobert  Mann,  an airline  industry  expert.  But Mann  thinks  Terrafugia  has come  closer  \nthan anyone  to making  the flying  car a reality.  The govemment  has already  permitted  \nthe company  to use special  materials  to make  it easier  for the vehicle  to fly. The \nTransition  is now going  through  crash  tests to make  sure it meets  federal  safety  \nstandards.  \nMann  said Terrafugia  was helped  by the Federal  Aviation  Administration’s  \ndecision  five years  ago to create  a separate  set of standards  for light sport  aircraft,  \nwhich  are lower  than those  pilots  of larger  planes . Terrafugia  says an owner  would  \nneed  to pass a test and complete  20 hours  of flying  time to be able to fly the \nTransition,  a requirement  pilots  would  find redatively  easy to meet.  \n28. What  is the first paragraph  mainly  about?  \nA. The basic  data of the Transition.      B. The advantages  of flying  cars. \nC. The potential  market  for flying  cars.  D. The designers  of the Transition.  \n29. Why  is the Transition  unlikely  to show  up in too many  driveways?  \nA. It causes  traffic  jams.              B. It is difficult  to operate.  \nC. It is very expensive.               D. It bums  too much  fuel. \n30. What  is the government’s  attitude  to the development  of the flying  car? \nA. Cautious .      B. Favorable.      C.

            "question": "D \nWhen  a leafy  plant  is under  attack , it doesn’t  sit quietly.  Back  in 1983,  two \nscientists,  Jack Schultz  and Ian Baldwin,  reported  that young  maple  trees  getting  \nbitten  by insects  send out a particular  smell  that neighboring  plants  can get. These  \n  chemicals  come  from  the injured  parts  of the plant  and seem  to be an alarm.  What  the \nplants  pump  through  the air is a mixture  of chemicals  known  as volatile  organic  \ncompounds,  VOCs  for short.  \nScientists  have  found  that all kinds  of plants  give out VOCs  when  being  \nattacked.  It’s a plant’s  way of crying  out. But is anyone  listening?  Apparently.  \nBecause  we can watch  the neighbours  react.  \nSome  plants  pump  out smelly  chemicals  to keep  insects  away.  But others  do \ndouble  duty.  They  pump  out perfumes  designed  to attract  different  insects  who are \nnatural  enemies  to the attackers.  Once  they arrive,  the tables  are turned . The attacker  \nwho was lunching  now becomes  lunch.  \nIn study  after study,  it appears  that these  chemical  conversations  help the \nneighbors.  The damage  is usually  more  serious  on the first plant,  but the neighbors,  \nrelatively  speaking,  stay safer  because  they heard  the alarm  and knew  what  to do. \nDoes  this mean  that plants  talk to each other?  Scientists  don’t  know.  Maybe  the \nfirst plant  just made  a cry of pain or was sending  a message  to its own branches,  and \nso, in effect,  was talking  to itself.  Perhaps  the neighbors  just happened  to “overhear”  \nthe cry. So information  was exchanged,  but it wasn’t  a true, intentional  back  and \nforth.  \nCharles  Darwin,  over 150 years  ago, imagined  a world  far busier,  noisier  and \nmore  intimate  (亲密的 ) than the world  we can see and hear.  Our senses  are weak.  \nThere’s  a whole  lot going  on. \n32. What  does a plant  do when  it is under  attack?  \nA. It makes  noises.      B. It gets help from  other  plants.  \nC. It stands  quietly      D. It sends  out certain  chemicals.  \n33. What  does the author  mean  by “the tables  are turned”  in paragraph  3? \nA. The attackers  get attacked.  \nB. The insects  gather  under  the table.  \nC. The plants  get ready  to fight  back.  \nD. The perfumes  attract  natural  enemies.  \n34.

Though the movie is 30 years old, most of the 250 seats were filled with teary-eyed audience wanting to say good-bye to the old building. Theater owner Ed Bradford said he chose the movie because it seemed appropriate. The movie is set in a small town where the only movie theater is preparing to close down.\nBradford said that large modern theaters in the city made it impossible for the Plaza to compete. He added that the theater’s location (位置) was also a reason. “This used to be the center of town,” he said. “Now the area is mostly office buildings and warehouses.”\nLast week some city officials suggested the city might be interested in turning the old theater into a museum and public meeting place. However, these plans were abandoned because of financial problems. Bradford sold the building and land to a local development firm, which plans to build a shopping complex on the land where the theater is located.\nThe theater audience said good-bye as Bradford locked the doors for the last time. After 75 years the Plaza Theater has shown its last movie. The theater will be missed.\n24. In what way was yesterday’s cleanup at the Plaza special?\nA. It made room for new equipment.\nB. It signaled the closedown of the theater.\nC. It was done with the help of the audience.\nD. It marked the 75th anniversary of the theater.\n25. Why was The Last Picture Show put on?\nA. It was an all-time classic.     \t\tB. It was about the history of the town.\nC. The audience requested it.     \tD. The theater owner found it suitable.\n26. What will probably happen to the building?\nA. It will be repaired.      \t\tB. It will be turned into a museum.\nC. It will be knocked down.    \tD. It will be sold to the city government. \n27. What can we infer about the audience?\nA. They are disappointed with Bradford.  \nB. They are sad to part with the old theater. \nC. They are supportive of the city officials.  \nD. They are eager to have a shopping center.\n",

            "question": "C\nAfter years of heated debate, gray wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park. Fourteen wolves were caught in Canada and transported to the park. By last year, the Yellowstone wolf population had grown to more than 170 wolves.\nGray wolves once were seen here and there in the Yellowstone area and much of the continental United States, but they were gradually displaced by human development. By the 1920s, wolves had practically disappeared from the Yellowstone area. They went farther north into the deep forests of Canada, where there were fewer humans around.\nThe disappearance of the wolves had many unexpected results. Deer and elk populations — major food sources (来源) for the wolf — grew rapidly. These animals consumed large amounts of vegetation (植被), which reduced plant diversity in the park. In the absence of wolves, coyote populations also grew quickly. The coyotes killed a large percentage of the park’s red foxes, and completely drove away the park’s beavers.\nAs early as 1966, biologists asked the government to consider reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone Park. They hoped that wolves would be able to control the elk and coyote problems. Many farmers opposed the plan because they feared that wolves would kill their farm animals or pets.\n    The government spent nearly 30 years coming up with a plan to reintroduce the wolvers. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service carefully monitors and manages the wolf packs in Yellowstone. Today, the debate continues over how well the gray wolf is fitting in at Yellowstone. Elk, deer, and coyote populations are down, while beavers and red fores have made a comeback. The Yellowstone wolf project has been a valuable experiment to help biologists decide whether to reintroduce wolves to other parts of the country as well.\n28. What is the text mainly about?\nA. Wildlife research in the United States.\nB. Plant diversity in the Yellowstone area.\nC. The conflict between farmers and gray wolves.\nD. The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park.\n29. What does the underlined word “displaced” in paragraph 2 mean?\nA. Tested.\t\tB. Separated.\t\tC. Forced out.\t\tD. Tracked down.\n30. What did the disappearance of gray wolves bring about？\nA. Damage to local ecology.     B. A decline in the park’s income.\nC. Preservation of vegetation.    D. An increase in the variety of animals.\n31. What is the author’s attitude towards the Yellowstone wolf project？\nA. Doubtful.       B. Positive.      C. Disapproving.      D. Uncaring.\n",

            "question": "D\nThe Intelligent Transport team at Newcastle University have turned an electric car into a mobile laboratory named “Drive LAB” in order to understand the challenges faced by older drivers and to discover where the key stress points are.\nResearch shows that giving up driving is one of the key reasons for a fall in health and well-being among older people, leading to them becoming more isolated (隔绝) and inactive.\nLed by Professor Phil Blythe, the Newcastle team are developing in-vehicle technologies for older drivers which they hope could help them to continue driving into later life.\nThese include custom-made navigation (导航) tools, night vision systems and intelligent speed adaptations. Phil Blythe explains: “For many older people, particularly those living alone or in the country, driving is important for preserving their independence, giving them the freedom to get out and about without having to rely on others.”\n“But we all have to accept that as we get older our reactions slow down and this often results in people avoiding any potentially challenging driving conditions and losing confidence in their driving skills. The result is that people stop driving before they really need to.”\nDr Amy Guo, the leading researcher on the older driver study, explains, “The Drive LAB is helping us to understand what the key points and difficulties are for older drivers and how we might use technology to address these problems.\n“For example, most of us would expect older drivers always go slower than everyone else but surprisingly, we found that in 30mph zones they struggled to keep at a constant speed and so were more likely to break the speed limit and be at risk of getting fined. We’re looking at the benefits of systems which control their speed as a way of preventing that.\n“We hope that our work will help with technological solutions (解决方案) to ensure that older drivers stay safer behind the wheel.”\n32. What is the purpose of the Drive LAB?\nA. To explore newmeans of transport.       B. To design new types of cars.\nC. To find out older driver’s problems.      D. To teach people traffic rules.\n33. Why is driving important for older people according to Phil Blythe?\nA. It keeps them independent.      B. It helps them save time.\nC. It builds up their strength.       D. It cures their mental illnesses.\n34. What do researchers hope to do for older drivers?\nA. Improve their driving skills.         B. Develop driver-assist technologles.\nC.

When  the the world  was still \n  populated  by hunter-gatherers,  small,  tightly  knit (联系 ) groups  developed  their own \npatterns  of speech  independent  of each other.  Some  language  experts  believe  that \n10,000  years  ago, when  the world  had just five to ten million  people,  they spoke  \nperhaps  12,000  languages  between  them.  \nSoon  afterwards,  many  of those  people  started  settling  down  to become  farmers,  \nand their languages  too became  more  settled  and fewer  in number.  In recent  centres,  \ntrade,  industrialisation , the development  of the nation-state  and the spread  of universal  \ncompulsory  education.  Especially  glbalisation  and better  communications  in the past \nfew decades,  all have  caused  many  Languages  to disappear,  and dominant  languages  \nsuch as English . Spanish  and Chinese  are increasingly  taking  over.  \nAt present,  the world  has about  6,800 languages.  The distribution  of these  \nlanguages  is hugely  uneven.  The general  rule is that mild zones  have  relatively  few \nlanguages.  Often  spoken  by many  people  while  hot, wet zones  have  lots, often  spoken  \nby small  numbers.  Europe  has only around  200 Languages:  the Americas  about  1,000.  \nAfrica  2,400; and Asia and the Pacific  perhaps  3,200,  of which  Papua  New  Guinea  \nalone  accounts  for well over 800.

That’s  bad news  for the environment  — \nand our wallets  — as these  outdated  devices  consume  much  more  energy  than the \nnewer  ones that do the same  things.  \nTo figure  out how much  power  these  devices  are using,  Callie  Babbitt  and her \ncolleagues  at the Rochester  Institute  of Technology  in New  York  tracked  the \nenvironmental  costs  for each product  throughout  its life — from  when  its minerals  are \nmined  to when  we stop using  the device.  This method  provided  a readout  for how \nhome  energy  use has evolved  since  the early  1990s.  Devices  were  grouped  by \ngeneration  — Desktop  computers,  basic  mobile  phones,  and box-set  TVs defined  \n1992.  Digital  cameras  arrived  on the scene  in 1997.  And MP3  players,  smart  phones,  \nand LCD  TVs entered  homes  in 2002,  before  tablets  and e-readers  showed  up in 2007.  \nAs we accumulated  more  devices,  however,  we didn ’t throw  out our old ones.  \n“The living-room  television  is replaced  and gets planted  in the kids’ room,  and \nsuddenly  one day, you have  a TV in every  room  of the house, ” said one researcher.  \nThe average  number  of electronic  devices  rose from  four per household  in 1992  to 13 \nin 2007.  We’re not just keeping  these  old devices  — we continue  to use them.  \nAccording  to the analysis  of Babbitt ’s team,  old desktop  monitors  and box TVs with \ncathode  ray tubes  are the worst  devices  with their energy  consumption  and \ncontribution  to greenhouse  gas emissions （排放） more  than doubling  during  the \n1992  to 2007  window.  \n  So what ’s the solution（解决方案） ? The team ’s data only went  up to 2007,  but \nthe researchers  also explored  what  would  happen  if consumers  replaced  old products  \nwith new electronics  that serve  more  than one function,  such as a tablet  for word  \nprocessing  and TV viewing.  They  found  that more  on-demand  entertainment  viewing  \non tablets  instead  of TVs and desktop  computers  could  cut energy  consumption  by \n44%.  \n32. What  does the author  think  of new devices?  \nA. They  are environment-friendly.   B. They  are no better  than the old. \nC. They  cost more  to use at home.   D. They  go out of style  quickly.  \n33. Why  did Babbitt's  team  conduct  the research?  \nA. To reduce  the cost of minerals.  \nB. To test the life cycle  of a product.  \nC. To update  consumers  on new technology.  \nD. To find out electricity  consumption  of the devices.  \n34. Which  of the following  uses the least energy?  \nA. The box-set  TV.    B.

            "question": "B \nMany  of us love July because  it’s the month  when  nature’s  berries  and stone  \nfruits  are in abundance.  These  colourful  and sweet  jewels  from  British  Columbia’s  \nfields  are little powerhouses  of nutritional  protection.  \nOf the common  berries,  strawberries  are highest  in vitamin  C, although,  because  \nof their seeds,  raspberries  contain  a little more  protein  (蛋白质 ), iron and zinc (not \nthat fruits  have  much  protein).  Blueberries  are particularly  high in antioxidants  (抗氧\n化 物 质 ). The yellow  and orange  stone  fruits  such as peaches  are high in the \ncarotenoids  we turn into vitamin  A and which  are antioxidants.  As for cherries  (樱桃\n), they are so delicious  who cares?  However,  they are rich in vitamin  C. \nWhen  combined  with berries  or slices  of other  fruits,  frozen  bananas  make  an \nexcellent  base for thick,  cooling  fruit shakes  and low fat “ice cream”.  For this \npurpose,  select  ripe bananas  for freezing  as they are much  sweeter.  Remove  the skin \nand place  them  in plastic  bags or containers  and freeze.  If you like, a squeeze  of fresh  \nlemon  juice  on the bananas  will prevent  them  turning  brown.  Frozen  bananas  will last \nseveral  weeks,  depending  on their ripeness  and the temperature  of the freezer.  \nIf you have  a juicer , you can simply  feed in frozen  bananas  and some  berries  or \nsliced  fruit.  Out comes  a “soft-serve”  creamy  dessert,  to be eaten  right  away.  This \nmakes  a fun activity  for a children’s  party;  they love feeding  the fruit and frozen  \nbananas  into the top of the machine  and watching  the ice cream  come  out below.  \n24.

            "question": "C \nTeens  and younger  children  are reading  a lot less for fun, according  to a \nCommon  Sense  Media  report  published  Monday.  \nWhile  the decline  over the past decade  is steep  for teen readers,  some  data in the \nreport  shows  that reading  remains  a big part of many  children’s  lives,  and indicates  \nhow parents  might  help encourage  more  reading.  \nAccording  to the report’s  key findings,  “the proportion  (比例 ) who say they \n‘hardly  ever’  read for fun has gone  from  8 percent  of 13-year-olds  and 9 percent  of \n17-year-olds  in 1984  to 22 percent  and 27 percent  respectively  today.”  \nThe report  data shows  that pleasure  reading  levels  for younger  children,  ages \n2-8, remain  largely  the same.  But the amount  of time spent  in reading  each session  \nhas declined,  from  closer  to an hour or more  to closer  to a half hour per session.  \nWhen  it comes  to technology  and reading,  the report  does little to counsel  (建议\n) parents  looking  for data about  the effect  of e-readers  and tablets  on reading.  It does \npoint  out that many  parents  still limit  electronic  reading,  mainly  due to concerns  \nabout  increased  screen  time.  \nThe most  hopeful  data shared  in the report  shows  clear  evidence  of parents  \nserving  as examples  and important  guides  for their kids when  it comes  to reading.  \nData  shows  that kids and teens  who do read frequently,  compared  to infrequent  \nreaders,  have  more  books  in the home,  more  books  purchased  for them,  parents  who \nread more  often,  and parents  who set aside  time for them  to read.  \nAs the end of school  approaches,  and school  vacation  reading  lists loom  (逼近 ) \nahead,  parents  might  take this chance  to step in and make  their own summer  reading  \nlist and plan a family  trip to the library  or bookstore.  \n28.

            "question": "D \nWe’ve  all been  there:  in a lift, in line at the bank  or on an airplane,  surrounded  \nby people  who are, like us, deeply  focused  on their smartphones  or, worse,  struggling  \nwith the uncomfortable  silence.  \nWhat’s  the problem?  It’s possible  that we all have  compromised  conversational  \nintelligence.  It’s more  likely  that none  of us start a conversation  because  it’s \nawkward  and challenging,  or we think  it’s annoying  and unnecessary.  But the next \ntime you find yourself  among  strangers,  consider  that small  talk is worth  the trouble.  \nExperts  say it’s an invaluable  social  practice  that results  in big benefits.  \nDismissing  small  talk as unimportant  is easy,  but we can’t  forget  that deep  \nrelationships  wouldn’t  even  exist  if it weren’t  for casual  conversation.  Small  talk is \nthe grease  (润滑剂 ) for social  communication,  says Bernardo  Carducci,  director  of \nthe Shyness  Research  Institute  at Indiana  University  Southeast.  “Almost  every  great  \nlove story  and each big business  deal begins  with small  talk,”  he explains.  “The  key \nto successful  small  talk is learning  how to connect  with others,  not just communicate  \nwith them.”  \nIn a 2014  study,  Elizabeth  Dunn,  associate  professor  of psychology  at UBC,  \ninvited  people  on their way into a coffee  shop.  One group  was asked  to seek out an \ninteraction  (互动 ) with its waiter;  the other,  to speak  only when  necessary.  The \nresults  showed  that those  who chatted  with their server  reported  significantly  higher  \npositive  feelings  and a better  coffee  shop  experience.  “It’s not that talking  to the \nwaiter  is better  than talking  to your husband,”  say Dunn.  “But  interactions  with \nperipheral  (边缘的 ) members  of our social  network  matter  for our well-being  also.”  \nDunn  believes  that people  who reach  out to strangers  feel a significantly  greater  \nsense  of belonging,  a bond  with others.  Carducci  believes  developing  such a sense  of \nbelonging  starts  with small  talk. “Small  talk is the basis  of good  manners,”  he says.  \n32. What  phenomenon  is described  in the first paragraph?  \nA. Addiction  to smartphones.  \nB. Inappropriate  behaviours  in public  places.  \nC. Absence  of communication  between  strangers.  \nD. Impatience  with slow  service.  \n33. What  is important  for successful  small  talk according  to Carducci?  \nA. Showing  good  manners.     B. Relating  to other  people.  \nC. Focusing  on a topic.      D. Making  business  deals.  \n34. What  does the coffee-shop  study  suggest  about  small  talk?  \nA. It improves  family  relationships.   B. It raises  people’s  confidence.  \nC. It matters  as much  as formal  talk.  D. It makes  people  feel good.  \n35. What  is the best title for the text?  \nA. Conversation  Counts      B.

            "question": "B\nCities usually have a good reason for being where they are, like a nearby port or river. People settle in these places because they are easy to get to and naturally suited to communications and trade. New York City, for example, is near a large harbour at the mouth of the Hudson River. Over 300 years its population grew gradually from 800 people to 8 million. But not all cities develop slowly over a long period of time. Boom towns grow from nothing almost overnight. In 1896, Dawson, Canada, was unmapped wilderness (荒野). But gold was discovered there in 1897, and two years later, it was one of the largest cities in the West, with a population of 30,000.\nDawson did not have any of the natural conveniences of cities like London or Paris. People went there for gold. They travelled over snow-covered mountains and sailed hundreds of miles up icy rivers. The path to Dawson was covered with thirty feet of wet snow that could fall without warming. An avalanche(雪崩) once closed the path, killing 63 people. For many who made it to Dawson, however, the rewards were worth the difficult trip. Of the first 20,000 people who dug for gold, 4,000 got rich. About 100 of these stayed rich men for the rest of their lives.\nBut no matter how rich they were, Dawson was never comfortable. Necessities like food and wood were very expensive. But soon, the gold that Dawson depended on had all been found. The city was crowded with disappointed people with no interest in settling down, and when they heard there were new gold discoveries in Alaska, they left Dawson City as quickly as they had come. Today, people still come and go — to see where the Canadian gold rush happened. Tourism is now the chief industry of Dawson City — its present population is 762.\n24. What attracted the early settlers to New York City?\nA. Its business culture.            B. Its small population.[来]\nC. Its geographical position.        D. Its favourable climate.\n25. What do we know about those who first dug for gold in Dawson?\nA. Two-thirds of them stayed there.      B. One out of five people got rich.\nC. Almost everyone gave up.           D. Half of them died.\n26. What was the main reason for many people to leave Dawson?\nA. They found the city too crowded.   B. They wanted to try their luck elsewhere.\nC. They were unable to stand the winter.   D. They were short of food.\n27. What is the text mainly about?\nA. The rise and fall of a city.         B. The gold rush in Canada.\nC. Journeys into the wilderness.      D. Tourism in Dawson.\n",

            "question": "C\nWhile famous foreign architects are invited to lead the designs of landmark buildings in China such as the new CCTV tower and the National Center for the Performing Arts, many excellent Chinese architects are making great efforts to take the center stage.\nTheir efforts have been proven fruitful. Wang Shu, a 49-year-old Chinese architect, won the 2012 Pritzker Architecture Prize — which is often referred to as the Nobel Prize in architecture — on February 28. He is the first Chinese citizen to win this award.\nWang serves as head of the Architecture Department at the China Academy of Art (CAA). His office is located at the Xiangshan campus (校园) of the university in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. Many buildings on the campus are his original creations.\nThe style of the campus is quite different from that of most Chinese universities. Many visitors were amazed by the complex architectural space and abundant building types. The curves (曲线) of the buildings perfectly match the rise and fall of hills, forming a unique view.\nWang collected more than 7 million abandoned bricks of different ages. He asked the workers to use traditional techniques to make the bricks into walls, roofs and corridors. This creation attracted a lot of attention thanks to its mixture of modern and traditional Chinese elements (元素).\nWang’s works show a deep understanding of modern architecture and a good knowledge of traditions. Through such a balance, he had created a new type of Chinese architecture, said Tadao Ando, the winner of the 1995 Pritzker Prize.\nWang believes traditions should not be sealed in glass boxes at museums. “That is only evidence that traditions once existed,” he said.\n“Many Chinese people have a misunderstanding of traditions. They think tradition means old things from the past. In fact, tradition also refers to the things that have been developing and that are still being created,” he said.\n“Today, many Chinese people are learning Western styles and theories rather than focusing on Chinese traditions. Many people tend to talk about traditions without knowing what they really are,” said Wang.学K]\nThe study of traditions should be combined with practice. Otherwise, the recreation of traditions would be artificial and empty, he said.\n28. Wang’s winning of the prize means that Chinese architects are ___________.\nA. following the latest world trend       B. getting international recognition\nC. working harder than ever before       D. relying on foreign architects\n29. What impressed visitors to the CAA Xiangshan campus most?\nA. Its hilly environment. \tB. Its large size.\nC. Its unique style.\t\t\tD. Its diverse functions.\n30. What made Wang’s architectural design a success?\nA. The mixture of different shapes.       B. The balance of East and West.\nC. The use of popular techniques.        D. The harmony of old and new.\n31. What should we do about Chinese traditions according to Wang?\nA. Spread them to the world.\t\t\tB. Preserve them at museums.\nC. Teach them in universities.\t\t\tD. Recreate them in practice.\n",

The good news is that I can help my own kids learn earlier than I did how to live more with less. \nI found the pre-holidays a good time to encourage young children to donate less-used things, and it worked. Because of our efforts, our daughter Georgia did decide to donate a large bag of toys to a little girl whose mother was unable to pay for her holiday due to illness. She chose to sell a few larger objects that were less often used when we promised to put the money into her school fund (基金) (our kindergarten daughter is serious about becoming a doctor).\nFor weeks, I’ve been thinking of bigger, deeper questions: How do we make it a habit for them? And how do we train ourselves to help them live with, need, and use less? Yesterday, I sat with my son, Shepherd, determined to test my own theory on this. I decided to play with him with only one toy for as long as it would keep his interest. I expected that one toy would keep his attention for about five minutes, ten minutes, max. I chose a red rubber ball—simple, universally available. We passed it, he tried to put it in his mouth, he tried bouncing it, rolling it, sitting on it, throwing it. It was totally, completely enough for him. Before I knew it an hour had passed and it was time to move on to lunch.\nWe both became absorbed in the simplicity of playing together. He had my full attention and I had his. My little experiment to find joy in a single object worked for both of us.\n32. What do the words “more is more” in paragraph 1 probably mean?\nA. The more, the better.\t\t\t\t\tB. Enough is enough.\nC. More money, more worries.\t\t\tD. Earn more and spend more.\n33. What made Georgia agree to sell some of her objects?\nA. Saving up for her holiday \t\t\t\tB. Raising money for a poor girl\nC. Adding the money to her fund \t\t\tD. Giving the money to a sick mother\n34. Why did the author play the ball with Shepherd?\nA.

His teacher ,Thomas Whaley ,is next to him, whispering support.“…Vote for …me …”Except for some stumbles, Chris is doing amazingly well. When he brings his speech to a nice conclusion ,Whaley invites the rest of the class to praise him.\nA son of immigrants, Chris stared learning English a little over three years ago. Whaley recalls(回想起)how at the beginning of the year，when called upon to read，Chris would excuse himself to go to the bathroom.\nLearning English as a second language can be a painful experience. What you need is a great teacher who lets you make mistakes. “It takes a lot for any student，” Whaley explains，“especially for a student who is learning English as their new language，to feel confident enough to say，‘I don’t know，but I want to know.’”\nWhaley got the idea of this second-grade presidential campaign project when he asked the children one day to raise their hands if they thought they could never be a president. The answer broke his heart. Whaley says the project is about more than just learning to read and speak in public.

At present, these technologies are still expensive, though.\nResearchers from Georgia Tech say that they have come up with a low-cost device(装置)that gets around this problem: a smart keyboard. This smart keyboard precisely measures the cadence(节奏)with which one types and the pressure fingers apply to each key. The keyboard could offer a strong layer of security by analyzing things like the force of a user's typing and the time between key presses. These patterns are unique to each person. Thus, the keyboard can determine people's identities, and by extension, whether they should be given access to the computer it's connected to—regardless of whether someone gets the password right.\nIt also doesn't require a new type of technology that people aren't already familiar with. Everybody uses a keyboard and everybody types differently.\nIn a study describing the technology, the researchers had 100 volunteers type the word “touch”four times using the smart keyboard. Data collected from the device could be used to recognize different participants based on how they typed, with very low error rates. The researchers say that the keyboard should be pretty straightforward to commercialize and is mostly made of inexpensive, plastic-like parts. The team hopes to make it to market in the near future.\n28. Why do the researchers develop the smart keyboard?\nA. To reduce pressure on keys.\tB. To improve accuracy in typing\nC.

            "question": "D\nDuring the rosy years of elementary school(小学), I enjoyed sharing my dolls and jokes, which allowed me to keep my high social status. I was the queen of the playground. Then came my tweens and teens, and mean girls and cool kids. They rose in the ranks not by being friendly but by smoking cigarettes, breaking rules and playing jokes on others, among whom I soon found myself.\nPopularity is a well-explored subject in social psychology. Mitch Prinstein, a professor of clinical psychology sorts the popular into two categories: the likable and the status seekers. The likables’ plays-well-with-others qualities strengthen schoolyard friendships, jump-start interpersonal skills and, when tapped early, are employed ever after in life and work. Then there’s the kind of popularity that appears in adolescence: status born of power and even dishonorable behavior.\nEnviable as the cool kids may have seemed, Dr. Prinstein’s studies show unpleasant consequences. Those who were highest in status in high school, as well as those least liked in elementary school, are “most likely to engage(从事)in dangerous and risky behavior.”\nIn one study, Dr. Prinstein examined the two types of popularity in 235 adolescents, scoring the least liked, the most liked and the highest in status based on student surveys(调查研究). “We found that the least well-liked teens had become more aggressive over time toward their classmates. But so had those who were high in status. It clearly showed that while likability can lead to healthy adjustment, high status has just the opposite effect on us.\"\nDr. Prinstein has also found that the qualities that made the neighbors want you on a play date-sharing, kindness, openness — carry over to later years and make you better able to relate and connect with others.\nIn analyzing his and other research，Dr. Prinstein came to another conclusion: Not only is likability related to positive life outcomes, but it is also responsible for those outcomes, too. \"Being liked creates opportunities for learning and for new kinds of life experiences that help somebody gain an advantage, ” he said.\n32. What sort of girl was the author in her early years of elementary school?\nA. Unkind.\tB. Lonely.\tC. Generous.\tD. Cool.\n33. What is the second paragraph mainly about？\nA.

            "question": "B\n“You can use me as a last resort(选择), and if nobody else volunteers，then I will do it.” This was an actual reply from a parent after I put out a request for volunteers for my kids lacrosse(长曲棍球)club.\nI guess that there's probably some demanding work schedule, or social anxiety around stepping up to help for an unknown sport. She may just need a little persuading. So I try again and tug at the heartstrings. I mention the single parent with four kids running the show and I talk about the dad coaching a team that his kids aren’t even on … At this point the unwilling parent speaks up,“Alright. Yes, I’ll do it.”\nI’m secretly relieved because I know there’s real power in sharing volunteer responsibilities among many. The unwilling parent organizes the meal schedule, sends out emails, and collects money for end-of-season gifts. Somewhere along the way, the same parent ends up becoming an invaluable member of the team. The coach is able to focus on the kids while the other parents are relieved to be off the hook for another season. Handing out sliced oranges to bloodthirsty kids can be as exciting as watching your own kid score a goal.\nStill, most of us volunteers breathe a sigh of relief when the season comes to a close. That relief is coupled with a deep understanding of why the same people keep coming back for more: Connecting to the community(社区)as you freely give your time, money, skills, or services provides a real joy. Volunteering just feels so good.\nIn that sense, I’m pretty sure volunteering is more of a selfish act than I’d freely like to admit. However, if others benefit in the process, and I get some reward too, does it really matter where my motivation lies?\n24. What can we infer about the parent from her reply in paragraph l？\nA. She knows little about the club.\nB. She isn't good at sports.\nC. She just doesn't want to volunteer.\nD. She's unable to meet her schedule.\n25. What does the underlined phrase“tug at the heartstrings”in paragraph 2 mean ?\nA. Encourage team work.\nB. Appeal to feeling.\nC. Promote good deeds\nD. Provide advice.\n26. What can we learn about the parent from paragraph 3?\nA. She gets interested in lacrosse.\nB. She is proud of her kids.\nC. She’ll work for another season.\nD. She becomes a good helper.\n27. Why does the author like doing volunteer work?\nA. It gives her a sense of duty.\nB. It makes her very happy.\nC. It enables her to work hard.\nD. It brings her material rewards.\n",

Lunch is Bechtel’s “me” time. And like more Americans, she’s not alone.\nA new report found 46 percent of meals are eaten alone in America.

Today $8 or $10 seems a small amount of money, but at that time these amounts were forbidding to most citizens. Accordingly, newspapers were read almost only by rich people in politics or the trades. In addition, most newspapers had little in them that would appeal to a mass audience. They were dull and visually forbidding. But the revolution that was taking place in the 1830s would change all that.\nThe trend, then, was toward the \"penny paper\"-a term referring to papers made widely available to the public. It meant any inexpensive newspaper; perhaps more importantly it meant newspapers that could be bought in single copies on the street.\nThis development did not take place overnight. It had been possible(but not easy)to buy single copies of newspapers before 1830,but this usually meant the reader had to go down to the printer's office to purchase a copy. Street sales were almost unknown. However, within a few years, street sales of newspapers would be commonplace in eastern cities. At first the price of single copies was seldom a penny-usually two or three cents was charged-and some of the older well-known papers charged five or six cents. But the phrase \"penny paper \" caught the public's fancy, and soon there would be papers that did indeed sell for only a penny.\nThis new trend of newspapers for \"the man on the street\" did not begin well. Some of the early ventures(企业)were immediate failures. Publishers already in business, people who were owners of successful papers, had little desire to change the tradition. It took a few youthful and daring businessmen to get the ball rolling.\n28. Which of the following best describes newspapers in America before the 1830s?\nA. Academic.\tB. Unattractive.\tC. Inexpensive.\tD. Confidential.\n29. What did street sales mean to newspapers?\nA. They would be priced higher.\tB. They would disappear from cities.\nC. They could have more readers.\tD. They could regain public trust.\n30. Who were the newspapers of the new trend targeted at?\nA. Local politicians.\tB. Common people.\nC. Young publishers.\tD. Rich businessmen.\n31. What can we say about the birth of the penny paper?\nA. It was a difficult process.\tB. It was a temporary success.\nC. It was a robbery of the poor.\tD. It was a disaster for printers.\n",

In addition ,most newspapers had little in them that would appeal to mass audience. They were dull and visually forbidding.”可知，在19世纪30年代之前,只有富人才能读报纸，而且大多数报纸中几乎没有能吸引大众的内容，让人感觉无聊，，视觉上令人望而却步。由此可得出那时的报纸没有什么吸引力。分析选项，A . Academic学术的；B. Unattractive没有吸引力， 无魅力的； C. Inexpensive廉价的，不贵的； D. Confidential机密的，保密的。可知 A、C和D是错误的，只有B符合题意，故选B。\n【29题详解】\n推理判断题。根据第二段提到“便士报纸”针对大众，很便宜的。更重要的是，在街上可以买的到报纸。 结合第三段中间的“streets sales of newspapers would be commonplaced in eastern cities”可知，报纸的街头销售随处可见。由此可推断出，街头销售意味读报纸的多了。分析选项可知C符合题，故选C。\n【30题详解】\n细节理解题。根据第二段中的“The trend, then, was ‘penny paper’—a term referring to papers made widely available to the public. perhaps more importantly it meant newspapers that could be bought in single copies on the street.”可知，这种“便士报纸”针对大众的，在街上可以买的到报纸。分析选项可知，选项B符合题意，故选B。\n【31题详解】\n推理判断题。第二段“The trend, then, was ‘penny paper’”及最后一段“The new trend of newspapers for ‘the man on the street’ did not begin well. Some of the early ventures were immediately failures. Publishers already in business, people who owners of successful papers, had little desires to change the tradition. It took a few youthful and daring businessmen to get the ball rolling.”可知，“便士报纸”新趋势一开始并不好，一些早期的尝试立即失败了。已经进入商业领域的成功的出版商，并不想改变这一传统。后来一些年轻而大胆的商人才推动了这件事。由此可推断出“便士报纸”的诞生是一个困难而曲折的过程。分析选项可知，A项符合题意，故选A。\n",

            "question": "D\nMonkeys seem to have a way with numbers.\nA team of researchers trained three Rhesus monkeys to associate 26 clearly different symbols consisting of numbers and selective letters with 0-25 drops of water or juice as a reward. The researchers then tested how the monkeys combined—or added—the symbols to get the reward.\nHere's how Harvard Medical School scientist Margaret Livingstone, who led the team, described the experiment: In their cages the monkeys were provided with touch screens. On one part of the screen, a symbol would appear, and on the other side two symbols inside a circle were shown. For example, the number 7 would flash on one side of the screen and the other end would have 9 and 8. If the monkeys touched the left side of the screen they would be rewarded with seven drops of water or juice; if they went for the circle, they would be rewarded with the sum of the numbers—17 in this example.\nAfter running hundreds of tests, the researchers noted that the monkeys would go for the higher values more than half the time, indicating that they were performing a calculation, not just memorizing the value of each combination.\nWhen the team examined the results of the experiment more closely, they noticed that the monkeys tended to underestimate(低估)a sum compared with a single symbol when the two were close in value—sometimes choosing, for example, a 13 over the sum of 8 and 6. The underestimation was systematic: When adding two numbers, the monkeys always paid attention to the larger of the two, and then added only a fraction(小部分)of the smaller number to it.\n\"This indicates that there is a certain way quantity is represented in their brains, \"Dr. Livingstone says. “But in this experiment what they're doing is paying more attention to the big number than the little one.”\n32. What did the researchers do to the monkeys before testing them?\nA. They fed them.\tB. They named them.\nC. They trained them.\tD. They measured them.\n33. How did the monkeys get their reward in the experiment?\nA. By drawing a circle.\tB. By touching a screen.\nC. By watching videos.\tD. By mixing two drinks.\n34. What did Livingstone's team find about the monkeys?\nA. They could perform basic addition.\tB. They could understand simple words.\nC. They could memorize numbers easily.\tD.

There’s a welcome familiarity - but also sometimes a slight suspicion that time has changed you both, and thus the relationship. But books don’t change, people do. And that’s what makes the act of rereading so rich and transformative.\nThe beauty of rereading lies in the idea that our bond with the work is based on our present mental register. It’s true, the older I get, the more I feel time has wings. But with reading, it’s all about the present. It’s about the now and what one contributes to the now, because reading is a give and take between author and reader. Each has to pull their own weight.\nThere are three books I reread annually The first, which I take to reading every spring is Emest Hemningway’s A Moveable Feast. Published in 1964, it’s his classic memoir of 1920s Paris. The language is almost intoxicating (令人陶醉的)，an aging writer looking back on an ambitious yet simpler time. Another is Annie Dillard’s Holy the Firm, her poetic 1975 ramble (随笔) about everything and nothing. The third book is Julio Cortazar’s Save Twilight: Selected Poems, because poetry. And because Cortazar.\nWhile I tend to buy a lot of books, these three were given to me as gifs, which might add to the meaning I attach to them. But I imagine that, while money is indeed wonderful and necessary, rereading an author’s work is the highest currency a reader can pay them. The best books are the ones that open further as time passes. But remember, it’s you that has to grow and read and reread in order to better understand your friends.\n24. Why does the author like rereading?\nA. It evaluates the writer-reader relationship.\nB. It’s a window to a whole new world.\nC. It’s a substitute for drinking with a friend.\nD. It extends the understanding of oneself.\n25. What do we know about the book A Moveable Feas!?\nA. It’s a brief account of a trip.\nB. It’s about Hemingway’s life as a young man.\nC. It’s a record of a historic event.\nD. It’s about Hemingway’s friends in Paris.\n26. What does the underlined word ＂currency＂ in paragraph 4 refer to?\nA. Debt\nB. Reward.\nC. Allowance.\nD.

            "question": "C\nRace walking shares many fitness benefits with running, research shows, while most likely contributing to fewer injuries. It does, however, have its own problem.\nRace walkers are conditioned athletes. The longest track and field event at the Summer Olympics is the 50-kilometer race walk, which is about five miles longer than the marathon. But the sport’s rules require that a race walker’s knees stay straight through most of the leg swing and one foot remain in contact (接触) with the ground at all times. It’s this strange form that makes race walking such an attractive activity, however, says Jaclyn Norberg, an assistant professor of exercise science at Salem State University in Salem, Mass.\nLike running, race walking is physically demanding, she says, According to most calculations, race walkers moving at a pace of six miles per hour would burn about 800 calories(卡路里) per hour, which is approximately twice as many as they would burn walking, although fewer than running, which would probably burn about 1,000 or more calories per hour.\nHowever, race walking does not pound the body as much as running does, Dr. Norberg says. According to her research, runners hit the ground with as much as four times their body weight per step, while race walkers, who do not leave the ground, create only about 1.4 times their body weight with each step.\nAs a result, she says, some of the injuries associated with running, such as runner’s knee, are uncommon among race walkers. But the sport’s strange form does place considerable stress on the ankles and hips, so people with a history of such injuries might want to be cautious in adopting the sport. In fact, anyone wishing to try race walking should probably first consult a coach or experienced racer to learn proper technique, she says. It takes some practice.\n28. Why are race walkers conditioned athletes?\nA. They must run long distances.\nB. They are qualified for the marathon.\nC. They have to follow special rules.\nD. They are good at swinging their legs.\n29. What advantage does race walking have over running?\nA. It’s more popular at the Olympics.\nB. It’s less challenging physically.\nC. It’s more effective in body building.\nD. It’s less likely to cause knee injuries.\n30. What is Dr. Norberg’s suggestion for someone trying race walking?\nA. Getting experts’ opinions.\nB. Having a medical checkup.\nC. Hiring an experienced coach.\nD. Doing regular exercises.\n31. Which word best describes the author’s attitude to race walking?\nA. Skeptical.\tB. Objective.\nC.

A study conducted in Youngstown，Ohio，for example, discovered that greener areas of the city experienced less crime. In another，employees were shown to be 15% more productive when their workplaces were decorated with houseplants.\nThe engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT)have taken it a step further changing the actual composition of plants in order to get them to perform diverse，even unusual functions. These include plants that have sensors printed onto their leaves to show when they’re short of water and a plant that can detect harmful chemicals in groundwater. ＂We’re thinking about how we can engineer plants to replace functions of the things that we use every day,＂explained Michael Strano, a professor of chemical engineering at MIT.\nOne of his latest projects has been to make plants glow(发光)in experiments using some common vegetables. Strano’s team found that they could create a faint light for three-and-a-half hours. The light，about one-thousandth of the amount needed to read by，is just a start. The technology, Strano said, could one day be used to light the rooms or even to turn tree into self-powered street lamps.\nin the future，the team hopes to develop a version of the technology that can be sprayed onto plant leaves in a one-off treatment that would last the plant’s lifetime. The engineers are also trying to develop an on and off＂switch＂where the glow would fade when exposed to daylight.\nLighting accounts for about 7% of the total electricity consumed in the US. Since lighting is often far removed from the power source(电源)-such as the distance from a power plant to street lamps on a remote highway-a lot of energy is lost during transmission(传输).\nGlowing plants could reduce this distance and therefore help save energy.\n32.

Puzzle play was found to be a significant predictor of cognition(认知) after controlling for differences in parents’ income, education and the amount of parent talk, Levine said.\nThe researchers analyzed video recordings of 53 child-parent pairs during everyday activities at home and found children who play with puzzles between 26 and 46 months of age have better spatial skills when assessed at 54 months of age.\n“The children who played with puzzles performed better than those who did not, on tasks that assessed their ability to rotate(旋转)and translate shapes,” Levine said in a statement.\nThe parents were asked to interact with their children as they normally would, and about half of children in the study played with puzzles at one time. Higher-income parents tended to have children play with puzzles more frequently, and both boys and girls who played with puzzles had better spatial skills. However, boys tended to play with more complex puzzles than girls, and the parents of boys provided more spatial language and were more active during puzzle play than parents of girls.\nThe findings were published in the journal Developmental Science.\n24.

But some ecologists and fashion (时装)enthusiasts are trying to bring back the market for fur made from nutria(海狸鼠).\nUnusual fashion shows in New Orleans and Brooklyn have showcased nutria fur made into clothes in different styles. “It sounds crazy to talk about guilt-free fur-unless you understand that the nutria are destroying vast wetlands every year”, says Cree McCree, project director of Righteous Fur.\nScientists in Louisiana were so concerned that they decided to pay hunters $5 a tail. Some of the fur ends up in the fashion shows like the one in Brooklyn last month.\nNutria were brought there from Argentina by fur farmers and let go into the wild. “The ecosystem down there can’t handle this non-native species(物种).It’s destroying the environment. It’s them or us.” says Michael Massimi, an expert in this field.\nThe fur trade kept nutria in check for decades，but when the market for nutria collapsed in the late 1980s，the cat-sized animals multiplied like crazy.\nBiologist Edmond Mouton runs the nutria control program for Louisiana. He says it’s not easy to convince people that nutria fur is green, but he has no doubt about it. Hunters bring in more than 300,000 nutria tails a year, so part of Mouton’s job these days is trying to promote fur.\nThen there’s Righteous Fur and its unusual fashion. Model Paige Morgan says，”To give people a guilt-free option that they can wear without someone throwing paint on them-1 think that’s going to be a massive thing, at least here in New York.” Designer Jennifer Anderson admits it took her a while to come around to the opinion that using nutria fur for her creations is morally acceptable. She trying to come up with a lable to attach to nutria fashions to show it is eco-friendly.\n28. What is the purpose of the fashion shows in New Orleans and Brooklyn?\nA. To promote guilt-free fur.\nB. To expand the fashion market.\nC. To introduce a new brand.\nD. To celebrate a winter holiday.\n29. Why are scientists concerned about nutria?\nA. Nutria damage the ecosystem seriously.\nB. Nutria are an endangered species.\nC. Nutria hurt local cat-sized animals.\nD. Nutria are illegally hunted.\n30. What does the underlined word “collapsed” in paragraph 5 probably mean?\nA. Boomed.\tB. Became mature.\tC. Remained stable.\tD. Crashed.\n31. What can we infer abouf wearing fur in New York according to Morgan?\nA. It’s formal.\tB. It’s risky.\tC. It’s harmful.\tD. It’s traditional.\n",

Instead, one activist, dressed in a full-body monkey suit, had arrived with a sign praising the filmmakers: “Thanks for not using real apes (猿)!”\nThe creative team behind “Apes” used motion-capture (动作捕捉) technology to create digitalized animals, spending tens of millions of dollars on technology that records an actor’s performance and later processes it with computer graphics to create a final image (图像).

One nonprofit organization, which monitors the treatment of animals in filmed entertainment, is keeping tabs on more than 2,000 productions this year. Already, a number of films, including “Water for Elephants,” “The Hangover Part Ⅱ” and “Zookeeper,” have drawn the anger of activists who say the creatures acting in them haven’t been treated properly.\nIn some cases, it’s not so much the treatment of the animals on set in the studio that has activists worried; it’s the off-set training and living conditions that are raising concerns.

Rita cuts in: “We spoke more with Nick because I think it’s a big thing for Nick to live with his mother-in-law.”\nAnd what does Nick think? “From my standpoint, it all seems to work very well. Would I recommend it? Yes, I think I would.”\nIt’s hard to tell exactly how many people agree with him, but research indicates that the numbers have been rising for some time. Official reports suggest that the number of households with three generations living together had risen from 325,000 in 2001to 419,000 in 2013.\nOther varieties of multigenerational family are more common. Some people live with their elderly parents; many more adult children are returning to the family home, if they ever left. It is said that about 20% of 25-34-year-olds live with their parents, compared with 16% in 1991.The total number of all multigenerational households in Britain is thought to be about 1.8 million.\nStories like that are more common in parts of the world where multigenerational living is more firmly rooted. In India, particularly outside cities, young women are expected to move in with their husband’s family when they get married.\n28.

As scientists look deeper into our genes (基因), they are finding examples of human evolution in just the past few thousand years. People in Ethiopian highlands have adapted to living at high altitudes. Cattle -raising people in East Africa and northern Europe have gained a mutation (突变) that helps them digest milk as adults.\nOn Thursday in an article published in Cell, a team of researchers reported a new kind of adaptation - not to air or to food, but to the ocean. A group of sea-dwelling people in Southeast Asia have evolved into better divers. The Bajau, as these people are known, number in the hundreds of thousands in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. They have traditionally lived on houseboats; in recent times, they’ve also built houses on stilts (支柱) in coastal waters. “They are simply a stranger to the land,” said Redney C. Jubilado, a University of Hawaii researcher who studies the Bajau.\nDr. Jubilado first met the Bajau while growing up on Samal Island in the Philippines. They made a living as divers, spearfishing or harvesting shellfish. “We were so amazed that they could stay underwater much longer than us local islanders,” Dr. Jubilado said. “I could see them actually walking under the sea.”\nIn2015, Melissa Ilardo, then a graduate student in genetics at the University of Copenhagen, heard about the Bajau. She wondered if centuries of diving could have led to the evolution of physical characteristics that made the task easier for them. “it seemed like the perfect chance for natural selection to act on a population,” said Dr. Ilardo. She also said there were likely a number of other genes that help the Bajau dive.\n32. What does the author want to tell us by the examples in paragraph 1?\nA.

However, that was small fry compared with the city’s Circus Maximus, which accommodated around 250,000 people.\nThese days, safety regulations-not to mention the modern sports fan’s desire for a good view and comfortable seat—tend to keep stadium capacities（容量） slightly lower. Even soccer fans tend to have a seat each; gone are the days of thousands standing to watch the match. \nFor the biggest stadiums in the world, we have used data supplied by the World Atlas list so far, which ranks them by their stated permanent capacity, as well as updated information from official stadium websites. \nAll these stadiums are still funtiona1, still open and still hosting the biggest events in world sport. \n·Rungrado 1st of May Stadium, Pyongyang D.P.R.

In fact plenty of younger kids have one in their pocket. Practically everyone can make and receive calls anywhere, anytime. \nStill, 55 percent of Australians have a landline phone at home and only just over a quarter （29%） rely only on their smartphones according to a survey （调查）. Of those Australians who still have a landline, a third concede that it’s not really necessary and they’re keeping it as a security blanket — 19 percent say they never use it while a further 13 percent keep it in case of emergencies. I think my home falls into that category. \nMore than half of Australian homes are still choosing to stick with their home phone. Age is naturally a factor（因素）— only 58 percent of Generation Ys still use landlines now and then, compared to 84 percent of Baby Boomers who’ve perhaps had the same home number for 50 years. Age isn’t the only factor; I’d say it’s also to do with the makeup of your household. \nGeneration Xers with young families, like my wife and I, can still find it convenient to have a home phone rather than providing a mobile phone for every family member. That said, to be honest the only people who ever ring our home phone are our Baby Boomers parents, to the point where we play a game and guess who is calling before we pick up the phone（using Caller ID would take the fun out of it）. \nHow attached are you to your landline?

            "question": "D\nDuring an interview for one of my books, my interviewer said something I still think about often. Annoyed by the level of distraction（干扰）in his open office, he said, “That’s why I have a membership at the coworking space across the street — so I can focus”. His comment struck me as strange. After all, coworking spaces also typically use an open office layout（布局）. But I recently came across a study that shows why his approach works. \nThe researchers examined various levels of noise on participants as they completed tests of creative thinking. They were randomly divided into four groups and exposed to various noise levels in the background, from total silence to 50 decibels（分贝）, 70 decibels, and 85 decibels. The differences between most of the groups were statistically insignificant; however, the participants in the 70 decibels group — those exposed to a level of noise similar to background chatter in a coffee shop — significantly outperformed the other groups. Since the effects were small, this may suggest that our creative thinking does not differ that much in response to total silence and 85 decibels of background noise. \nBut since the results at 70 decibels were significant, the study also suggests that the right level of background noise — not too loud and not total silence — may actually improve one’s creative thinking ability. The right level of background noise may interrupt our normal patterns of thinking just enough to allow our imaginations to wander, without making it impossible to focus. This kind of “distracted focus” appears to be the best state for working on creative tasks. \nSo why do so many of us hate our open offices? The problem may be that, in our offices, we can’t stop ourselves from getting drawn into others’ conversations while we’re trying to focus. Indeed, the researchers found that face-to-face interactions and conversations affect the creative process, and yet a coworking space or a coffee shop provides a certain level of noise while also providing freedom from interruptions.\n32 Why does the interviewer prefer a coworking space?\nA.

The problem may be that, in our offices, we can't stop ourselves from getting drawn into others' conversations while we're trying to focus.

            "question": "B\nPort Lympne Reserve, which runs a breeding (繁育) programme, has welcomed the arrival of a rare black rhino calf (犀牛幼崽). When the tiny creature arrived on January 31, she became the 40th black rhino to be born at the reserve. And officials at Port Lympne were delighted with the new arrival, especially as black rhinos are known for being difficult to breed in captivity (圈养).\nPaul Beer, head of rhino section at Port Lympne, said: “Obviously we're all absolutely delighted to welcome another calf to our black rhino family. She's healthy, strong and already eager to play and explore. Her mother, Solio, is a first-time mum and she is doing a fantastic job. It's still a little too cold for them to go out into the open, but as soon as the weather warms up, I have no doubt that the little one will be out and about exploring and playing every day.”\nThe adorable female calf is the second black rhino born this year at the reserve, but it is too early to tell if the calves will make good candidates to be returned to protected areas of the wild. The first rhino to be born at Port Lympne arrived on January 5 to first-time mother Kisima and weighed about 32kg. His mother, grandmother and great grandmother were all born at the reserve and still live there.\nAccording to the World Wildlife Fund, the global black rhino population has dropped as low as 5500, giving the rhinos a “critically endangered” status.\n4.

            "question": "C\nWhen I was 9, we packed up our home in Los Angeles and arrived at Heathrow, London on a gray January morning. Everyone in the family settled quickly into the city except me. Without my beloved beaches and endless blue—sky days, I felt at a loss and out of place. Until I made a discovery.\nSouthbank, at an eastern bend in the Thames, is the center of British skateboarding, where the continuous crashing of skateboards left your head ringing .I loved it. I soon made friends with the local skaters. We spoke our own language. And my favorite: Safe. Safe meant cool. It meant hello. It meant don't worry about it. Once, when trying a certain trick on the beam（横杆）, I fell onto the stones, damaging a nerve in my hand, and Toby came over, helping me up: Safe, man. Safe. A few minutes later, when I landed the trick, my friends beat their boards loud, shouting: “ Safe! Safe! Safe!” And that's what mattered—landing tricks, being a good skater.\nWhen I was 15, my family moved to Washington. I tried skateboarding there, but the locals were far less welcoming. Within a couple of years, I'd given it up.\nWhen I returned to London in 2004, I found myself wandering down to Southbank, spending hours there. I've traveled back several times since, most recently this past spring. The day was cold but clear: tourists and Londoners stopped to watch the skaters. Weaving（穿梭）among the kids who rushed by on their boards, I found my way to the beam. Then a rail—thin teenager, in a baggy white T—shirt, skidded（滑）up to the beam. He sat next to me. He seemed not to notice the man next to him. But soon I caught a few of his glances. “I was a local here 20 years ago,” I told him. Then, slowly, he began to nod his head. “Safe, man. Safe.”\n“Yeah,” I said. “Safe.”\n8. What can we learn about the author soon after he moved to London?\nA. He felt disappointed.\tB. He gave up his hobby.\nC. He liked the weather there.\tD. He had disagreements with his family.\n9. What do the underlined words “Safe! Safe! Safe!” probably mean?\nA. Be careful!\tB. Well done!\tC. No way!\tD. Don't worry!\n10. Why did the author like to spend time in Southbank when he returned to London?\nA. To join the skateboarding.\tB. To make new friends.\nC. To learn more tricks.\tD. To relive his childhood days\n11. What message does the author seem to convey in the text?\nA. Children should learn a second language.\nB. Sport is necessary for children's health.\nC. Children need a sense of belonging\nD.

            "question": "D\nWho is a genius? This question has greatly interested humankind for centuries.\nLet's state clearly: Einstein was a genius. His face is almost the international symbol for genius. But we want to go beyond one man and explore the nature of genius itself. Why is it that some people are so much more intelligent or creative than the rest of us? And who are they? \nIn the sciences and arts, those praised as geniuses were most often white men, of European origin. Perhaps this is not a surprise. It's said that history is written by the victors, and those victors set the standards for admission to the genius club. When contributions were made by geniuses outside the club—women, or people of a different color or belief—they were unacknowledged and rejected by others.\nA study recently published by Science found that as young as age six, girls are less likely than boys to say that members of their gender(性别)are “really, really smart.” Even worse, the study found that girls act on that belief: Around age six they start to avoid activities said to be for children who are “really, really smart.” Can our planet afford to have any great thinkers become discouraged and give up? It doesn't take a genius to know the answer: absolutely not.\nHere's the good news. In a wired world with constant global communication, we're all positioned to see flashes of genius wherever they appear. And the more we look, the more we will see that social factors(因素)like gender, race, and class do not determine the appearance of genius. As a writer says, future geniuses come from those with “intelligence, creativity, perseverance(毅力), and simple good fortune, who are able to change the world.”\n12. What does the author think of victors' standards for joining the genius club?\nA. They're unfair.\tB. They're conservative.\nC. They're objective.\tD. They're strict.\n13. What can we infer about girls from the study in Science?\nA. They think themselves smart.\nB. They look up to great thinkers.\nC. They see gender differences earlier than boys.\nD. They are likely to be influenced by social beliefs\n14 Why are more geniuses known to the public?\nA. Improved global communication.\nB. Less discrimination against women.\nC. Acceptance of victors' concepts.\nD. Changes in people's social positions.\n15. What is the best title for the text?\nA. Geniuses Think Alike\tB. Genius Takes Many Forms\nC.

            "question": "B\nIn 1916, two girls of wealthy families, best friends from Auburn, N. Y.—Dorothy Woodruff and Rosamond Underwood—traveled to a settlement in the Rocky Mountains to teach in a one-room schoolhouse. The girls had gone to Smith College. They wore expensive clothes. So for them to move to Elkhead, Colo. to instruct the children whose shoes were held together with string was a surprise. Their stay in Elkhead is the subject of Nothing Daunted: The Unexpected Education of Two Society Girls in the West by Dorothy Wickenden, who is a magazine editor and Dorothy Woodruff’s granddaughter.\n Why did they go then? Well, they wanted to do something useful. Soon, however, they realized what they had undertaken.\nThey moved in with a local family, the Harrisons, and, like them, had little privacy, rare baths, and a blanket of snow on their quilt when they woke up in the morning. Some mornings, Rosamond and Dorothy would arrive at the schoolhouse to find the children weeping from the cold. In spring, the snow was replaced by mud over ice. \nIn Wickenden’s book, she expanded on the history of the West and also on feminism, which of course influenced the girls’ decision to go to Elkhead. A hair-raising section concerns the building of the railroads, which entailed (牵涉) drilling through the Rockies, often in blinding snowstorms. The book ends with Rosamond and Dorothy’s return to Auburn.\nWickenden is a very good storyteller. The sweep of the land and the stoicism (坚忍) of the people move her to some beautiful writing. Here is a picture of Dorothy Woodruff, on her horse, looking down from a hill top: “When the sun slipped behind the mountains, it shed a rosy glow all around them. Then a full moon rose. The snow was marked only by small animals: foxes, coyotes, mice, and varying hares, which turned white in the winter.” \n4. Why did Dorothy and Rosamond go to the Rocky Mountains?\nA. To teach in a school.\tB. To study American history.\nC. To write a book.\tD. To do sightseeing.\n5. What can we learn about the girls from paragraph 3?\nA. They enjoyed much respect.\tB. They had a room with a bathtub.\nCThey lived with the local kids.\tD. They suffered severe hardships.\n6. Which part of Wickenden’s writing is hair-raising?\nA. The extreme climate of Auburn.\tB. The living conditions in Elkhead.\nC. The railroad building in the Rockies.\tD. The natural beauty of the West.\n7. What is the text?\nA. A news report.\tB. A book review.\tC. A children’s story.\tD.

That is the very likely future of applying today’s “eyes in the sky” technology to making sure that the millions of kilometres of rail tracks and infrastructure(基础设施)worldwide are safe for trains on a 24/7 basis. \nDrones are already being used to examine high-tension electrical lines. They could do precisely the same thing to inspect railway lines and other vital aspects of rail infrastructure such as the correct position of railway tracks and switching points. The more regularly they can be inspected, the more railway safety, reliability and on-time performance will be improved. Costs would be cut and operations would be more efficient(高效)across the board. \nThat includes huge savings in maintenance costs and better protection of railway personnel safety. It is calculated that European railways alone spend approximately 20 billion euros a year on maintenance, including sending maintenance staff, often at night, to inspect and repair the rail infrastructure. That can be dangerous work that could be avoided with drones assisting the crews’ efforts. \nBy using the latest technologies, drones could also start providing higher-value services for railways, detecting faults in the rail or switches, before they can cause any safety problems. To perform these tasks, drones for rail don’t need to be flying overhead. Engineers are now working on a new concept: the rail drones of the future. They will be moving on the track ahead of the train, and programmed to run autonomously. Very small drones with advanced sensors and AI and travelling ahead of the train could guide it like a co-pilot. With their ability to see ahead, they could signal any problem, so that fast-moving trains would be able to react in time.\n8. What makes the application of drones to rail lines possible?\nA. The use of drones in checking on power lines.\tB. Drones’ ability to work at high altitudes.\nC. The reduction of cost in designing drones.\tD. Drones’ reliable performance in remote areas.\n9.

            "question": "D\nThe Government's sugar tax on soft drinks has brought in half as much money as Ministers first predicted it would generate, the first official data on the policy has shown. \nFirst announced in April, 2016, the tax which applies to soft drinks containing more than 5g of sugar per 100ml, was introduced to help reduce childhood obesity（肥胖）. It is believed that today's children and teenagers are consuming three times the recommended level of sugar, putting them at a higher risk of the disease. \nInitially the sugar tax was expected to make £520m a year for the Treasury. However, data of the first six months showed it would make less than half this amount. At present it is expected to generate £240m for the year ending in April 2019, which will go to school sports. \nIt comes after more than half of soft drinks sold in shops have had their sugar levels cut by manufacturers（制造商）so they can avoid paying the tax. Drinks now contain 45 million fewer kilos of sugar as a result of manufacturers' efforts to avoid the charge, according to Treasury figures. Since April drinks companies have been forced to pay between 18p and 24p for every litre of sugary drink they produce or import, depending on the sugar content. \nHowever, some high sugar brands, like Classic Coca Cola, have accepted the sugar tax and are refusing to change for fear of upsetting consumers. Fruit juices, milk-based drinks and most alcoholic drinks are free of the tax, as are small companies manufacturing fewer than 1m litres per year. \nToday's figures, according to one government official, show the positive influence the sugar tax is having by raising millions of pounds for sports facilities（设施）and healthier eating in schools. Helping the next generation to have a healthy and active childhood is of great importance, and the industry is playing its part. \n12. Why was the sugar tax introduced?\nA. To collect money for schools.\tB. To improve the quality of drinks.\nC. To protect children’s health.\tD. To encourage research in education.\n13. How did some drinks companies respond to the sugar tax?\nA. They turned to overseas markets.\tB. They raised the prices of their products.\nC. They cut down on their production.\tD. They reduced their products’ sugar content.\n14. From which of the following is the sugar tax collected?\nA. Most alcoholic drinks.\tB. Milk-based drinks.\tC. Fruit juices.\tD. Classic Coke.\n15. What can be inferred about the adoption of the sugar tax policy?\nA. It is a short-sighted decision.\tB. It is a success story.\nC. It benefits manufacturers.\tD. It upsets customers.\n",

Though not known to use tools in the wild, the birds have proved skilful at tool use while kept in the cage. In a recent experiment, cockatoos were presented with a box with a nut inside it. The clear front of the box had a “keyhole” in a geometric shape, and the birds were given five differently shaped “keys” to choose from. Inserting the correct “key” would let out the nut.\nIn humans, babies can put a round shape in a round hole from around one year of age, but it will be another year before they are able to do the same with less symmetrical (对称的) shapes. This ability to recognize that a shape will need to be turned in a specific direction before it will fit is called an “allocentric frame of reference”. In the experiment, Goffin’s cockatoos were able to select the right tool for the job, in most cases, by visual recognition alone. Where trial-and-error was used, the cockatoos did better than monkeys in similar tests. This indicates that Goffin’s cockatoos do indeed possess an allocentric frame of reference when moving objects in space, similar to two-year-old babies.\nThe next step, according to the researchers, is to try and work out whether the cockatoos rely entirely on visual clues (线索), or also use a sense of touch in making their shape selections.\n4.

            "question": "D\nSometime in the early 1960s, a significant thing happened in Sydney, Australia. The city discovered its harbor. Then, one after another, Sydney discovered lots of things that were just sort of there — broad parks, superb beaches, and a culturally diverse population. But it is the harbor that makes the city.\nAndrew Reynolds, a cheerful fellow in his early 30s, pilots Sydney ferryboats for a living. I spent the whole morning shuttling back and forth across the harbor. After our third run Andrew shut down the engine, and we went our separate ways — he for a lunch break, I to explore the city.\n“I’ll miss these old boats,” he said as we parted.\n“How do you mean?” I asked.\n“Oh, they’re replacing them with catamarans. Catamarans are faster, but they’re not so elegant, and they’re not fun to pilot. But that’s progress, I guess.”\nEverywhere in Sydney these days, change and progress are the watchwords (口号), and traditions are increasingly rare. Shirley Fitzgerald, the city’s official historian, told me that in its rush to modernity in the 1970s, Sydney swept aside much of its past, including many of its finest buildings. “Sydney is confused about itself,” she said. “We can’t seem to make up our minds whether we want a modern city or a traditional one. It’s a conflict that we aren’t getting any better at resolving (解决).”\nOn the other hand, being young and old at the same time has its attractions. I considered this when I met a thoughtful young businessman named Anthony. “Many people say that we lack culture in this country,” he told me. “What people forget is that the Italians, when they came to Australia, brought 2000 years of their culture, the Greeks some 3000 years, and the Chinese more still. We’ve got a foundation built on ancient cultures but with a drive and dynamism of a young country.
